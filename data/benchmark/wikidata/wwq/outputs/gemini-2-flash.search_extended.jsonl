Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what has shannen doherty played in?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find out what Shannen Doherty has acted in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what university did obama graduated from?"}, {"content": "Okay, let's start by identifying the entity \"Barack Obama\" in Wikidata.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"Barack Obama\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_65a32aaa-4e79-487d-9644-280a1658243b", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is the state governor of florida?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find the current state governor of Florida.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what year was hitler was born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"hitler\", \"kg\": \"wikidata\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_69ba42b1-c1a0-46f8-a15f-fca927790505", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did emperor hirohito live?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find the place where Emperor Hirohito lived.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are some of leonardo da vinci most famous inventions?"}, {"content": "Okay, let's start by identifying the entity \"Leonardo da Vinci\" in Wikidata.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"Leonardo da Vinci\", \"kg\": \"wikidata\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_6d6efd8d-c2a8-4c33-abcf-27c158a29284", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was john tyler?"}, {"content": "I need to figure out what the user is asking about John Tyler.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what galileo galilei was famous for?"}, {"content": "I need to find the properties that describe what Galileo Galilei was famous for.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"famous for\", \"entity\": \"wd:Q309\"}", "name": "search_property_of_entity"}, "id": "call_cf2f0ea4-84ec-4f35-a6ff-b32f18e16904", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 property alternatives:\n1. described by source, also known as mentioned in, source of item, reviewed in, mentioned in news article, talked about in (wd:P1343 as p/wdt): work where this item is described, attested in\n2. instance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as p): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n3. studied in, also known as is studied by, studied by, science, that studies, researched in, researched by (wd:P2579 as p/wdt): subject is studied by this science or domain, field of work\n4. different from, also known as not to be confused with, to be distinguished from, similar to, see also, rejected match (wd:P1889 as p/wdt): item that is different from another item, with which it may be confused\n5. exact match, also known as owl:sameAs, the same as, skos:exactMatch, same meaning, sameas (wd:P2888 as p/wdt): URL used to link two items or properties, indicating a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what type of political system is brazil?"}, {"content": "Okay, let's start by identifying the entity \"Brazil\" and the property related to its political system.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where do they speak tibetan?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find the places where Tibetan is spoken.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did the gettysburg address?"}, {"content": "I need to identify the entity \"Gettysburg Address\" and the property that represents the location where it was delivered.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the entity \"Gettysburg Address\".\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"Gettysburg Address\", \"kg\": \"wikidata\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_37ffc520-2874-4425-9d4f-b382c4edd583", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what character did billy d williams play in star wars?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find the character that Billy Dee Williams played in Star Wars.\nFirst, I'll search for Billy Dee Williams in Wikidata to get his entity ID.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"Billy Dee Williams\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_ce888c9e-90e6-4a71-90ef-174c8faeb800", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what school did sir ernest rutherford go to?"}, {"content": "Okay, let's start by identifying the entity \"Ernest Rutherford\" in Wikidata.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"Ernest Rutherford\", \"kg\": \"wikidata\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_6d1610aa-74ff-481d-acb6-f953fd91fdcb", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of airport in new york?"}, {"content": "I need to find the names of airports in New York.\n\nFirst, I need to find the entity for \"New York\".\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"New York\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_3e4d57ee-f75a-4fb2-818e-edc0601389f6", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the supreme court cases?"}, {"content": "I need to find the Wikidata entity for \"supreme court case\" and then find the property that links to specific cases.\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"supreme court case\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_03e46bec-2eea-4503-85da-1460e67a8daa", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who has played lex luthor?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find the actors who have played the role of Lex Luthor.\n\nFirst, I'll search for the entity \"Lex Luthor\" to get its Wikidata identifier.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"index": 0, "function": {"arguments": "{\"query\": \"Lex Luthor\", \"kg\": \"wikidata\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_3373286c-c730-4cf0-8c1f-2f9744b1b413", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what county is kansas city kansas?"}, {"content": "I need to find the county that Kansas City, Kansas is in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who does the voice for chucky in child's play?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find out who voices Chucky in the Child's Play movies.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what movies have robert pattinson in them?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find movies that Robert Pattinson has acted in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did the cleveland cavaliers draft?"}, {"content": "I need to find out what entities and properties are relevant to the Cleveland Cavaliers and the concept of drafting.

For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what movies did tupac star in?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find the movies that Tupac Shakur starred in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what movies gerard butler has been in?"}, {"content": "Okay, I need to find movies that Gerard Butler has been in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what type of cancer did eva peron die from?"}, {"content": "Okay, let's start by identifying the entities and properties involved in the question.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what do people in australia speak?"}, {"content": "I need to find the languages spoken in Australia.
