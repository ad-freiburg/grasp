Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In which thriller movies does Taylor Lautner appear?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entity for Taylor Lautner and the property that indicates his participation in movies.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who played as Barney and also starred in the film Barney Live in New York City?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the actor who played Barney and also appeared in the film \"Barney Live in New York City.\" Let's start by searching for the film \"Barney Live in New York City\" and then find the cast members associated with it.\n\nFirst, I will search for the film \"Barney Live in New York City\" in Freebase.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"freebase\", \"position\": \"subject\", \"query\": \"Barney Live in New York City\"}", "name": "search"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-472e8c5bee8c4314aa3de7291d8f4020", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What languiages are spoken by residents of the Central Western Time Zone?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the regions or cities that are part of the Central Western Time Zone and then find out what languages are spoken in those areas.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the primary religion practiced in the governmental jurisdiction that includes the governmental body Knesset?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the governmental jurisdiction that includes the governmental body Knesset and then find out the primary religion practiced in that jurisdiction.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

However, to be thorough, let's check if there is any information about the most utilized form of currency in Peru.\n\nWe will start by looking for properties related to the currency forms used in Peru.\n\n\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"freebase\", \"subject\": \"fb:m.016wzw\", \"property\": \"fb:location.country.currency_form\"}", "name": "list"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-86b53805acb548dc9f847f8e86fb250b", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Got no rows and 3 columns", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-86b53805acb548dc9f847f8e86fb250b"}, {"content": "It seems that there is no specific property in Freebase that directly indicates the most utilized form of currency in Peru.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the occupation of the artist that went on To Be Loved Tour?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the artist who went on the \"To Be Loved Tour\" and then find their occupation.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the latest film starring Tupac to be released?"}, {"content": "To find the latest film starring Tupac, we need to identify Tupac as an entity and then find films where he is listed as an actor.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What years' World Series were won by the sports team whose owner is Frank McCourt?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the sports team owned by Frank McCourt and then find out which years that team won the World Series.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What film directed by Angelina Jolie was written by Joel Coen?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the film directed by Angelina Jolie and written by Joel Coen.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the national anthem of the place where Tsakhur is spoken?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the place where Tsakhur is spoken and then find out what the national anthem of that place is.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which country with the ISO number of 100 is located in Eastern Europe?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the country with the ISO number 100 and verify that it is located in Eastern Europe.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which city was both where Nathan O.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which producer of Artifact dated Scarlett Johansson?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the producer of the game \"Artifact\" and then check if they have a relationship with Scarlett Johansson.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which schools attended by President Kennedy were founded before 1890?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the schools attended by President John F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What currency is used in the country that speaks Romansh?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the country where Romansh is spoken and then find out what currency is used in that country.

The Swiss Confederation is a federal directorial republic consisting of 26 cantons, with Bern as the seat of the federal authorities, called Bundesstadt. The country is situated in Western and Central Europe, where it is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of 41,285 km\u00b2. While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately 8 million people is concentrated mostly on the Plateau, where the largest cities are to be found; among them are the two global and economic centres of Z\u00fcrich and Geneva.\\nThe establishment of the Swiss Confederation is traditionally dated to 1 August 1291, which is celebrated annually as Swiss National Day. The country has a long history of armed neutrality\u2014it has not been in a state of war internationally since 1815\u2014and did not join the United Nations until 2002.: @en", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-43308040a3574fd3bd0753a59ce6cf5f"}, {"content": "It seems that the search for the currency of Switzerland did not yield any direct results.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

The closest matches were images or orders of battle, not the event itself.\n2. **Property Constraints**: Searches with property constraints like `fb:conflict.conflict.participants` and `fb:conflict.conflict.date` did not return any results.\n3. **Broader Context**: Searches for the Battle of Vicksburg in the context of the American Civil War also did not yield the correct entity.\n4. **Politicians**: Searches for politicians who fought in the American Civil War did not return any results, suggesting that the data structure in Freebase might not support this query.\n\n### Best Attempt\n```sparql\nPREFIX fb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/>\n\nSELECT ?politician ?positionStart\nWHERE {\n  ?politician a fb:people.person .\n  ?politician fb:military.military_person.conflicts ?conflict .\n  FILTER(?conflict = fb:m.02c7z_7) # Assuming fb:m.02c7z_7 is the Battle of Vicksburg\n  ?politician fb:government.politician.position_start_date ?positionStart .\n  FILTER(?positionStart > \"1875-10-19\"^^xsd:date)\n}\n```\n\nThis query assumes that `fb:m.02c7z_7` is the Battle of Vicksburg, which is not confirmed. Therefore, it may not return accurate results.\n\n### Final Answer\nI am unable to find a satisfactory SPARQL query to answer the question due to the limitations in the available data in the Freebase knowledge graph.\n\nIf you have any additional information or if you would like to try a different approach, please let me know.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"explanation\": \"Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to find the correct entity for the Battle of Vicksburg or the relevant politicians who fought in it.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which language spoken in Chile is a member of the Polynesian language group?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the language spoken in Chile that belongs to the Polynesian language group.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When was the person who said \"seriously, I do not think I'm fit for the presidency\" president?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the person who said \"seriously, I do not think I'm fit for the presidency\" and then find out when they were president.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which of JFK's brother held the latest governmental position?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify John F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On what radio station in New York City would you find an organizational leader named Gary Knell?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the organizational leader Gary Knell and then find out which radio station in New York City he is associated with.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which school attended by Eleanor Roosevelt has the largest number of undergraduates?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the schools attended by Eleanor Roosevelt and then find out which one has the largest number of undergraduate students.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What class of music did Mozart compose, and is the subject of the film, Everybody Does It?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the class of music composed by Mozart and also verify if it is the subject of the film \"Everybody Does It.\" We'll start by finding the entity for Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and then look for the types of music he composed.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which university has 9153 postgraduates and had Kevin Hart as a student?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the university that has 9153 postgraduates and also had Kevin Hart as a student.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "From what language family of Aragonese Languages did the Roman Language come from?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the language family of Aragonese and then trace back to see if Roman Language (likely referring to Latin or a related Romance language) is part of that family.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which award nominee in the 28th NAACP Image Awards dated Tupac Shakur?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the nominees for the 28th NAACP Image Awards and then check if any of them were involved in a relationship with Tupac Shakur.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What TV Drama show does Tamera Mowry act on?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about which TV drama show Tamera Mowry acts on, I need to identify Tamera Mowry as an entity and then find the TV shows she has acted in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which college attended by Kevin Hart has less than 9153 postgraduates?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the colleges attended by Kevin Hart and then check the number of postgraduates for those colleges.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The actor that played the character Jacob Black has starred in which movies?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the actor who played the character Jacob Black and then find the movies in which this actor has starred.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What country does Japan export to in the Newfoundland Time Zone?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the following elements:\n\n1. **Japan**: The country that exports.\n2. **Newfoundland Time Zone**: The time zone that the target country must be in.\n3. **Export Relationships**: The relationships between countries that indicate trade or exports.\n\nLet's start by searching for the entity representing Japan and the Newfoundland Time Zone.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Japan\nWe will search for the entity representing Japan.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Newfoundland Time Zone\nWe will search for the entity representing the Newfoundland Time Zone.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Export Relationships\nWe will look for properties that represent export relationships between countries.\n\nLet's start with the first step.\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Japan\nI will search for the entity representing Japan.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"freebase\", \"position\": \"subject\", \"query\": \"Japan\"}", "name": "search"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-655fa02e17b44ffdafc681154bd4cf9b", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Of the seven countries making up Central America, which countries have an ISO numeric larger than 188?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the countries in Central America and then filter those with an ISO numeric code greater than 188.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which system of government, does the location that appointed Nicolas Sarkozy, to governmental position utilize?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the location that appointed Nicolas Sarkozy to a governmental position and then determine the system of government utilized by that location.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the government system in place in the area of circulation for HaTzofe?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the government system in place in the area of circulation for HaTzofe, we need to identify the following:\n\n1. **HaTzofe**: We need to find the entity representing HaTzofe in the knowledge graph.\n2. **Area of Circulation**: Once we have HaTzofe, we need to find the area where it circulates.\n3. **Government System**: Finally, we need to find the government system in place in that area.\n\nLet's start by searching for HaTzofe in the Freebase knowledge graph.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"freebase\", \"position\": \"subject\", \"query\": \"HaTzofe\"}", "name": "search"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-d41e19b2541f4161b043b4a5a580a04f", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Name movie(s) Kim Richards acted in that released later than October 25, 2005.?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entity for Kim Richards and the property for movies she has acted in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series nominee did Tupac Shakur date?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the following:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What Charlie Hunnam work was production designed by Geoffrey Kirkland?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the works of Charlie Hunnam and then check which of these works had Geoffrey Kirkland as the production designer.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What movie was the prequel life to That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana and starred Miley Cyrus?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the movie that served as a prequel to \"That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana\" and starred Miley Cyrus.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which of JFK's brothers held his governmental position before November 6, 1962?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the following:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What stadium does the sports team owned by Thomas S.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who fought in the Battle of Vicksburg and was the 18th US president?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the person who fought in the Battle of Vicksburg and was also the 18th US President.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the name of the movie where Angelina Jolie directed Gabor Piroch?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the movie where Angelina Jolie directed Gabor Piroch.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which politician and brother of JFK ended his government post after 1968-06-06?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the politician who is also the brother of JFK and determine when he ended his government post.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What religion is practiced where Abdul Rahim Hatif has jurisdiction?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify Abdul Rahim Hatif and determine the location where he has jurisdiction.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which Spanish sports teams were founded after 1994?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify Spanish sports teams and their founding years.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which dramas have Charlie Hunman appeared in?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify Charlie Hunnam and then find the dramas he has appeared in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In which city with the largest GNIS feature ID does Lala Anthony reside?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the following elements:\n\n1. **Lala Anthony**: We need to find the entity representing Lala Anthony in the knowledge graph.\n2. **Residence**: We need to find the property that indicates where Lala Anthony resides.\n3. **City**: We need to identify the city where Lala Anthony resides.\n4. **GNIS Feature ID**: We need to find the property that represents the GNIS feature ID of the city and ensure it is the largest.\n\nLet's start by searching for Lala Anthony in the knowledge graph.\n\n### Step 1: Find Lala Anthony\nI will search for the entity representing Lala Anthony in the Freebase knowledge graph.\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"freebase\", \"position\": \"subject\", \"query\": \"Lala Anthony\"}", "name": "search"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-8f09d9a62e5047e1bed8948fe2a59f7b", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Of all the countries in Oceania, which one has an official symbol of an Illawarra Flame Tree?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the country in Oceania that has the Illawarra Flame Tree as an official symbol.

Andrew Jackson was the seventh President of the United States. He was born near the end of the colonial era, somewhere near the then-unmarked border between North and South Carolina, into a recently immigrated Scots-Irish farming family of relatively modest means. During the American Revolutionary War Jackson, whose family supported the revolutionary cause, acted as a courier. He was captured, at age 13, and mistreated by his British captors. He later became a lawyer, and in 1796 he was in Nashville and helped found the state of Tennessee. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and then to the U.S. Senate. In 1801, Jackson was appointed colonel in the Tennessee militia, which became his political as well as military base. Jackson owned hundreds of slaves who worked on the Hermitage plantation which he acquired in 1804. Jackson killed a man in a duel in 1806, over a matter of honor regarding his wife Rachel. Jackson gained national fame through his role in the War of 1812, most famously where he won a decisive victory over the main British invasion army at the Battle of New Orleans.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What region includes Belgium as well as the Lyon\u00e2\u0080\u0093Saint-Exup\u00c3\u00a9ry Airport?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the region that includes both Belgium and the Lyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What stop motion movie did Ron Howard do a voice in?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the stop motion movie and the role of Ron Howard in it.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What currency is used where Artur da Costa e Silva is from?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the country where Artur da Costa e Silva is from and then find out the currency used in that country.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

However, the specific number of undergraduate students (30,477) is not available in the Freebase knowledge graph, making it impossible to verify if any of these universities match the criteria.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe university J.R.R. Tolkien attended is Exeter College, Oxford. However, the specific number of undergraduate students (30,477) is not available in the Freebase knowledge graph, so we cannot confirm if this matches the criteria.\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"explanation\": \"The specific number of undergraduate students (30,477) is not available in the Freebase knowledge graph, making it impossible to verify if Exeter College, Oxford matches the criteria.\", \"best_attempt\": {\"sparql\": \"SELECT ?university ?label WHERE { fb:m.041h0 fb:people.person.education ?university .
