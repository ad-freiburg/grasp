Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when does ziva start on ncis?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5eb93195311245e2a8933bf7c673748e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat language does the country italy speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03rjj ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03rjj fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItaly, also known as Italia, Italian Republic (fb:m.03rjj): Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamenta...uch as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was michael jackson in the wiz?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.09889g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.09889g fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film fb:m.027fwmt .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Wiz (fb:m.027fwmt): The Wiz is a 1978 American musical adventure film produced in co...aptation of Charlie Smalls and Luther Vandross's songs for film., has type Award-Winning Work\nMichael Jackson, also known as Mike, Applehead, MJ, Smelly, Space Michael (fb:m.09889g): Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 \u2013 June 25, 2009) was an ...l Francis Admire Michael Jackson As His Best.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did benjamin franklin work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "68bccfde0f354d6792a74fbb6930cb2f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did ben hall do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.08sx40 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.08sx40 fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBen Hall, also known as The Gentleman Bushranger, Bold Ben Hall, Brave Ben Hall (fb:m.08sx40): Ben Hall was an Australian bushranger of the 19th century.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when was the last time the la kings won a playoff series?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c6345c97025a471ca86839fea68f987a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat year was peyton manning's rookie year?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.027jv8 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.027jv8 fb:sports.drafted_athlete.drafted ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_league_draft_pick.draft ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPeyton Manning, also known as Peyton Williams Manning (fb:m.027jv8): Peyton Williams Manning is an American football quarterback for ...onships, two AFC championships, and one Super Bowl championship., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nDrafted (fb:sports.drafted_athlete.drafted): links to type Sports League Draft Pick, part of Drafted athlete schema\nDraft (fb:sports.sports_league_draft_pick.draft): part of Sports League Draft Pick schema, links to type Sports League Draft\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat city is the university of maryland university college in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02mw1g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02mw1g fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUniversity of Maryland University College, also known as University of Maryland University College, main campus (fb:m.02mw1g): The University of Maryland University College is an American pub... which includes eleven separate public universities in Maryland., has type College/University\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the very first harry potter book?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03647x ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03647x fb:book.book_character.appears_in_book ?x .\n  ?x fb:book.written_work.date_written ?sk0 .\n}\nORDER BY xsd:datetime ( ?sk0 )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nHarry Potter, also known as The Boy Who Lived, Past Harry, Middle-Aged Harry Potter, Harry Potter Skit, Harry James Potter (fb:m.03647x): Harry James Potter is the title character of J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who makes the voice of stewie griffin?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "db15c4ff59a0479796a125b4ecd4ad9f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat illness does michael j fox have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0hz_1 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0hz_1 fb:medicine.notable_person_with_medical_condition.condition ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what voices does seth macfarlane play on family guy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e792a39ece534d059eb11136d982b445", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of aircraft does virgin america use?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03bwrn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03bwrn fb:aviation.aircraft_owner.aircraft_fleet_composition ?y .\n  ?y fb:aviation.aircraft_ownership_count.aircraft_model ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nVirgin America (fb:m.03bwrn): Virgin America, Inc. is a United States-based airline that began...ion to work with any companies that share the Virgin brand name., has type Airline\n\nUsing properties:\nAircraft Fleet Composition (fb:aviation.aircraft_owner.aircraft_fleet_composition): links to type Aircraft Ownership Count, part of Aircraft Owner schema\nAircraft Model (fb:aviation.aircraft_ownership_count.aircraft_model): part of Aircraft Ownership Count schema, links to type Aircraft model\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did adam sandler married?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0pz91 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0pz91 fb:people.person.spouse_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.spouse ?x .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.type_of_union fb:m.04ztj .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarriage, also known as Matrimony, Wedlock (fb:m.04ztj): Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or rit...of concerns for women's rights and because of international law., has type Religious Practice\nAdam Sandler, also known as Adam Richard Sandler, Sandman (fb:m.0pz91): Adam Richard Sandler is an American actor, comedian, screenwrite...developed the 2007 television sitcom series Rules of Engagement., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nSpouse (fb:people.marriage.spouse): part of Marriage schema, links to type Person\nType of union (fb:people.marriage.type_of_union): links to type Marriage/union type, part of Marriage schema\nSpouse (or domestic partner) (fb:people.person.spouse_s): links to type Marriage, part of Person schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is south carolina located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06yxd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06yxd fb:location.administrative_division.country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSouth Carolina, also known as Palmetto State, SC (fb:m.06yxd): South Carolina /\u02ccsa\u028a\u03b8 k\u00e6r\u0259\u02c8la\u026an\u0259/ is a state in the southeastern...rson-Mauldin metropolitan area had a 2013 population of 850,965., has type US State\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.administrative_division.country): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country", "tool_call_id": "e792a39ece534d059eb11136d982b445"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly relate to actors or voice roles, so I will now search for the entity \"Seth MacFarlane\" in the knowledge graph to identify his entity ID.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was franklin d roosevelt's job before president?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e976564ffab04bbc928c009c20e787e6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is madeira?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.04_z1 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.04_z1 fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMadeira, also known as Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma da Madeira (PT), Madeira Islands, Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma Da Madeira, Regiao Autonoma Da Madeira, P\u00e9rola do Atl\u00e2ntico (fb:m.04_z1): Madeira is a Portuguese archipelago located in the north Atlanti...ssified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and embroidery artisans., has type Administrative Division\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat is jessica ennis sport?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0b7nrg ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0b7nrg fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJessica Ennis-Hill, also known as Jessica Ennis (fb:m.0b7nrg): Jessica Ennis-Hill, CBE, n\u00e9e Ennis, is a British track and field...the 100 metres hurdles, the high jump and the indoor pentathlon., has type Olympic athlete\n\nUsing properties:\nProfession (fb:people.person.profession): links to type Profession, part of Person schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere did brad paisley graduate from college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03gr7w ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03gr7w fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n  ?y fb:education.education.degree fb:m.019v9k .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBachelor's degree, also known as Bachelor (fb:m.019v9k): A bachelor's degree is usually earned for an undergraduate cours... a pass degree, and in some universities a fourth year of study., has type Degree\nCollege/University, also known as College, University (fb:m.01y2hnl): The College/University type is used for institutions that offer ...mation, please see the Freebase wiki page on College/University.\nBrad Paisley, also known as Brad Douglas Paisley, Brad Paisey (fb:m.03gr7w): Brad Douglas Paisley is an American country music singer, songwr...songs for the Pixar Animation Studios Walt Disney Pictures Cars., has type Musical Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nDegree (fb:education.education.degree): part of Education schema, links to type Degree\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "e976564ffab04bbc928c009c20e787e6"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that the property fb:people.person.profession is used to find the profession or job of a person.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what state is barack obama from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "bcf12e42a4e240748a98ed78abe3897d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere was john f kennedy raised?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d3k14 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d3k14 fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn F.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where the missouri river ends?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "dbc01e08c18b4909b70e4590d1fdf7cf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhich airport to fly in rome?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06c62 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06c62 fb:travel.travel_destination.how_to_get_here ?y .\n  ?y fb:travel.transportation.transport_terminus ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01xpjyz .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAirport (fb:m.01xpjyz): An airport is a facility where aircraft such as airplanes and helicopters can take off and land.\nRome, also known as Comune of Rome, \u0420\u0438\u043c, The eternal City, the City of seven hills, Rome, Italy (fb:m.06c62): Rome is a city and special comune in Italy.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when did arsenal won the league?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "0bb06ab0a4a04f0f8623d69bd3bda5ac", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat county is jackson michigan in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.042tq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.042tq fb:location.hud_county_place.county ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJackson, also known as Jackson County / Jackson city, Jackson, Michigan (fb:m.042tq): Jackson is a city located along Interstate 94 in the south centr...It was founded in 1829 and named after President Andrew Jackson., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nCounty (fb:location.hud_county_place.county): part of HUD County Place schema, links to type US County\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhich province in canada is the most populated?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  {\n    SELECT ?x ( MAX( ?yr ) AS ?recent_yr ) WHERE {\n      fb:m.0d060g fb:location.location.contains ?x .\n      ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01nm .\n      ?x fb:location.statistical_region.population ?y .\n      ?y fb:measurement_unit.dated_integer.number ?p .\n      ?y fb:measurement_unit.dated_integer.year ?yr .\n    }\n    GROUP BY ?x\n  }\n  {\n    SELECT ?x ?p ?yr WHERE {\n      fb:m.0d060g fb:location.location.contains ?x .\n      ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01nm .\n      ?x fb:location.statistical_region.population ?y .\n      ?y fb:measurement_unit.dated_integer.number ?p .\n      ?y fb:measurement_unit.dated_integer.year ?yr .\n    }\n  }\n  FILTER ( ?yr = ?recent_yr )\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:integer ( ?p ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nCanadian Province (fb:m.01nm): A Canadian Province is the primary form of administrative divisi...ve their own provincial government.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did hugo chavez go to school?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a7d846bcd14b4a7c9d3a030246988cef", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat made roald dahl famous?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0ff2k ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0ff2k fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRoald Dahl, also known as Dahl, Roald, Roald Dal, Ronald Dahl (fb:m.0ff2k): Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, poet, scr...Adult works include Tales of the Unexpected and My Uncle Oswald., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nProfession (fb:people.person.profession): links to type Profession, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was the general for the british in the revolutionary war?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jnh ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jnh fb:military.military_conflict.commanders ?y .\n  ?y fb:military.military_command.military_commander ?x .\n  ?x fb:people.person.nationality fb:m.014tss .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKingdom of Great Britain (fb:m.014tss): The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain /\u0261re\u026at \u02c8b...hich ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at Culloden in 1746., has type Country\nAmerican Revolutionary War (fb:m.0jnh): The American Revolutionary War, the American War of Independence... government that took control of the province outside of Boston., has type Military Conflict\n\nUsing properties:\nMilitary Commander (fb:military.military_command.military_commander): links to type Military Commander, part of Military Command schema\nCommanders (fb:military.military_conflict.commanders): part of Military Conflict schema, links to type Military Command\nCountry of nationality (fb:people.person.nationality): part of Person schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat inventions did robert hooke made?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d6j4 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d6j4 fb:law.inventor.inventions ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRobert Hooke (fb:m.0d6j4): Robert Hooke FRS was an English natural philosopher, architect a...ay.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who played on the jeffersons?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "262dc39dcc3e4432abb3ac0c82d38916", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did drew stanton play in college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0bmqgn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0bmqgn fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team ?x .\n  ?x fb:sports.school_sports_team.school fb:m.01j_cy .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichigan State University, also known as Michigan State, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan State University, main campus, MSU (fb:m.01j_cy): Michigan State University is a public research university locate...re called the Spartans, which compete in the Big Ten Conference., has type College/University\nDrew Stanton, also known as Drew Emeric Stanton (fb:m.0bmqgn): Drew Emeric Stanton is an American football quarterback for the ... also been a member of the New York Jets and Indianapolis Colts., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nTeams (fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams): links to type Sports team roster, part of Athlete schema\nSchool (fb:sports.school_sports_team.school): links to type Educational Institution, part of School sports team schema\nTeam (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Sports Team\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho does northern ireland belong to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05bcl ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05bcl fb:location.administrative_division.first_level_division_of ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNorthern Ireland, also known as the North of Ireland, the occupied six counties, the six counties (fb:m.05bcl): Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britai...reland and Southern Ireland by an act of the British parliament., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nFirst level division of (fb:location.administrative_division.first_level_division_of): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere do the chicago cubs play?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01yjl ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01yjl fb:sports.sports_team.arena_stadium ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChicago Cubs (fb:m.01yjl): The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball franchise...ing to their crosstown rivals, the White Sox, four games to two., has type Professional Sports Team\n\nUsing properties:\nArena/Stadium (fb:sports.sports_team.arena_stadium): links to type Sports Facility, part of Sports Team schema", "tool_call_id": "262dc39dcc3e4432abb3ac0c82d38916"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query for people who played for a team or were part of a group, but \"The Jeffersons\" is a TV show, so we need to find the cast or actors who played on the TV show \"The Jeffersons.\"\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"The Jeffersons\" in the knowledge graph to identify its identifier.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"The Jeffersons\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_lRUxaY8g8lzSHzz7cxVYUbY6", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who played carmen cortez in spy kids?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "64347545269243688a26896087b46ee1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat does the name austin stand for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0vzm ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0vzm fb:symbols.namesake.named_after ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAustin, also known as Austin, Texas, Austin, TX, Williamson County / Austin city (fb:m.0vzm): Austin is the capital of the US state of Texas and the seat of T...blic's new capital and was incorporated under the name Waterloo., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nNamed after (fb:symbols.namesake.named_after): links to type Name source, part of Namesake schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was judy garland married to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0g10g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0g10g fb:people.person.spouse_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.spouse ?x .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.type_of_union fb:m.04ztj .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarriage, also known as Matrimony, Wedlock (fb:m.04ztj): Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or rit...of concerns for women's rights and because of international law., has type Religious Practice\nJudy Garland, also known as The Garland Sisters, Miss Show Business, Marie Gumm, Judy, Joots (fb:m.0g10g): Judy Garland was an American singer, actress, and vaudevillian. ...urn to acting, beginning with critically acclaimed performances., has type Musical Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nSpouse (fb:people.marriage.spouse): part of Marriage schema, links to type Person\nType of union (fb:people.marriage.type_of_union): links to type Marriage/union type, part of Marriage schema\nSpouse (or domestic partner) (fb:people.person.spouse_s): links to type Marriage, part of Person schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat style of art does andy warhol do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0kc6 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0kc6 fb:visual_art.visual_artist.associated_periods_or_movements ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAndy Warhol, also known as Andrew Varchola, Drella, Andrew Warhola, Jr., Andrew Warhola, Andrew Varchola, Jr. (fb:m.0kc6): Andy Warhol was an American artist who was a leading figure in t...man who lived openly as such before the gay liberation movement., has type Visual Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nAssociated periods or movements (fb:visual_art.visual_artist.associated_periods_or_movements): links to type Art Period/Movement, part of Visual Artist schema", "tool_call_id": "64347545269243688a26896087b46ee1"}, {"content": "The question is \"who played Carmen Cortez in Spy Kids?\" We need to find the entity for the character \"Carmen Cortez\" and the movie \"Spy Kids\" or the related film, then find the actor who played this character.\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"Carmen Cortez\" in the knowledge graph.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"Carmen Cortez\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_PbHhyVYG4SeSsQhrCeLwKtya", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where were greek temples built?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d082c51e53ae4287bc5fd2be68ee1f36", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat's jamaica country code?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03_r3 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03_r3 fb:base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.short_name ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJamaica (fb:m.03_r3): Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, comp...d Canada, and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nShort name (fb:base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.short_name): part of Administrative Area schema, links to type Text\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat planet was luke skywalker raised on?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f1bg ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f1bg fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLuke Skywalker (fb:m.0f1bg): Luke Skywalker is a fictional character appearing as the central...e Awakens, which is planned to be released on December 18, 2015., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nPlaces lived (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Setting\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is beside france?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f8l9c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f8l9c fb:location.location.adjoin_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.adjoining_relationship.adjoins ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01mp .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCountry, also known as Empire (fb:m.01mp): The type country in Freebase can and should be used with a varie...s with little population or autonomy will be typed as a country.\nFrance, also known as French Republic, R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise, l'Hexagone (fb:m.0f8l9c): France, officially the French Republic, is a sovereign state com...g and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nAdjoins (fb:location.adjoining_relationship.adjoins): part of Adjoining Relationship schema, links to type Location\nAdjoins (fb:location.location.adjoin_s): links to type Adjoining Relationship, part of Location schema", "tool_call_id": "d082c51e53ae4287bc5fd2be68ee1f36"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly address the question about where Greek temples were built, so I will proceed by searching for the entity \"Greek temple\" in the knowledge graph to identify its representation and related properties.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the current time in bangalore india?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "84f7bb871c1f47599340790568e05ba1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is azerbaijan?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jhd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jhd fb:base.locations.countries.continent ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAzerbaijan, also known as Republic of Azerbaijan, Az\u0259rbaycan Respublikas\u0131 (fb:m.0jhd): Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a transcon...ess to create a separate state as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nContinent (fb:base.locations.countries.continent): links to type Continents, part of Countries schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did barack obama attend school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02mjmr ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02mjmr fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBarack Obama, also known as President Obama, President Barack Obama, President Barack Hussein Obama II, President Barack H.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who was canadian prime minister in 1993?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ee6e661a53aa40229a3231ea3b93c1ab", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat are major exports of the usa?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.09c7w0 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.09c7w0 fb:location.statistical_region.major_exports ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.imports_exports_by_industry.industry ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited States of America, also known as U.S. of A., USA, U.S.A., US, U.S. (fb:m.09c7w0): The United States of America, commonly referred to as the United...s emerged from 13 British colonies located along the East Coast., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nIndustry (fb:location.imports_exports_by_industry.industry): part of Imports/exports by industry schema, links to type Industry\nMajor exports (fb:location.statistical_region.major_exports): links to type Imports/exports by industry, part of Statistical region schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen is the us open tennis mens final 2011?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  fb:m.0l6c9 fb:tennis.tennis_tournament.match_results ?y .\n  ?y fb:tennis.tennis_match.date ?x ; fb:tennis.tennis_match.match_format fb:m.04hdtlb .\n  FILTER ( xsd:dateTime ( ?x ) - xsd:dateTime ( \"2011-01-01\" ) >= 0 ) FILTER ( xsd:dateTime ( ?x ) - xsd:dateTime ( \"2011-12-31\" ) <= 0 )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMen's singles (fb:m.04hdtlb)\nThe US Open (Tennis), also known as us open tennis tournament, us open tennis championship, us open tennis, US Open, U.S. National Championship (fb:m.0l6c9): The United States Open Tennis Championships is a hardcourt tenni...the only major that employs tiebreakers in every set of a match., has type TV Program Creator\n\nUsing properties:\nDate (fb:tennis.tennis_match.date): part of Tennis Match schema, links to type Date/Time\nMatch Format (fb:tennis.tennis_match.match_format): links to type Tennis Match Type, part of Tennis Match schema\nMatch Results (fb:tennis.tennis_tournament.match_results): part of Tennis Tournament schema, links to type Tennis Match\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat countries in the world speak arabic?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jzc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jzc fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nArabic Language, also known as \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a, /m/0jzc, Arabic (fb:m.0jzc): Arabic /\u02c8\u00e6r\u0259b\u026ak/ is the Classical Arabic language of the 6th cen...her as a single language for political and/or religious reasons., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nSpoken in countries (fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country", "tool_call_id": "ee6e661a53aa40229a3231ea3b93c1ab"}, {"content": "To answer the question \"Who was Canadian prime minister in 1993?\", I need to identify the entity for Canada and the property related to the prime minister or head of government.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did steve spurrier play pro football for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2a13fca5426e493e98d5abd691763857", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat timezone is texas san antonio in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f2w0 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f2w0 fb:location.location.time_zones ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSan Antonio, also known as Comal County / San Antonio city, San Antonio, Texas, San Antonio, TX (fb:m.0f2w0): San Antonio, officially the City of San Antonio, is the seventh ...ke it likely that the metropolitan area will continue to expand., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nTime zone(s) (fb:location.location.time_zones): links to type Time Zone, part of Location schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat was the name of william shakespeare's children?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.081k8 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.081k8 fb:people.person.children ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nWilliam Shakespeare, also known as William 'Budd' Shakespeare, William Shakespare, Shaxper, William Shake-speare, William Shaksper (fb:m.081k8): William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright, and actor, ...ratford around 1613, at age 49, where he died three years later., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nChildren (fb:people.person.children): part of Person schema, links to type Person\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat challenges did helen keller have to face?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03ppx ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03ppx fb:base.qualia.disabled_person.disability ?y .\n  ?y fb:base.qualia.disability.type_of_disability ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHelen Keller, also known as Helen Adams Keller (fb:m.03ppx): Helen Adams Keller was an American author, political activist, a...l inductees to the Alabama Writers Hall of Fame on June 8, 2015., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nType of disability (fb:base.qualia.disability.type_of_disability): links to type Type of disability, part of Disability schema\nDisability (fb:base.qualia.disabled_person.disability): part of Disabled person schema, links to type Disability", "tool_call_id": "2a13fca5426e493e98d5abd691763857"}, {"content": "I will first search for the entity \"Steve Spurrier\" in the Freebase knowledge graph to get his identifier.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of king george vi wife?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "9f0b41bc11904423ac1afabf304b008b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat form of government does canada have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d060g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d060g fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCanada, also known as Canuckistan, Dominion of Canada (fb:m.0d060g): Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three terri...of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nForm of Government (fb:location.country.form_of_government): links to type Form of Government, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language people speak in afghanistan?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jdd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jdd fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAfghanistan, also known as Afganistan, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (fb:m.0jdd): Afghanistan /\u00e6f\u02c8\u0261\u00e6n\u0268st\u00e6n/, officially the Islamic Republic of Af..., Hotaks, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of language do irish speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03bkbh ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03bkbh fb:people.ethnicity.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIrish people, also known as Irish (fb:m.03bkbh): The Irish people are a nation and ethnic group who originate fro...an to set foot on American soil in Columbus' expedition of 1492., has type Ethnicity\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:people.ethnicity.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Ethnicity schema", "tool_call_id": "9f0b41bc11904423ac1afabf304b008b"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that the approach is to first find the entity for \"King George VI\" and then find the property related to his wife or spouse.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what team did david beckham play for before la galaxy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "608af56889dd4d74a9d36e46d27d93e4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere do houston aeros play?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.068hn0 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.068hn0 fb:sports.sports_team.arena_stadium ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened ?sk0 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk0 ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nHouston Aeros (fb:m.068hn0): The Houston Aeros were a professional ice hockey team in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1978., has type Ice hockey team\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nArena/Stadium (fb:sports.sports_team.arena_stadium): links to type Sports Facility, part of Sports Team schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do they speak in indonesia?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03ryn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03ryn fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIndonesia, also known as Republic of Indonesia, The Republic of Indonesia (fb:m.03ryn): Indonesia, officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a sovereign ... early centuries CE, and Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms flourished., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhen was blessed kateri born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01zql6 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01zql6 fb:people.person.date_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKateri Tekakwitha (fb:m.01zql6): Saint Kateri Tekakwitha, given the name Tekakwitha, baptized as ...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what year did baltimore ravens win super bowl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1c17176d8f964a1c893fdc0bd726a091", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is the mtv headquarters?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.04rqd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.04rqd fb:organization.organization.headquarters ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.mailing_address.citytown ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMTV (fb:m.04rqd): MTV is an American basic cable and satellite television channel ...2015, approximately 93,240,000 American households received MTV., has type TV Network\n\nUsing properties:\nCity/Town (fb:location.mailing_address.citytown): links to type Location, part of Address schema\nHeadquarters (fb:organization.organization.headquarters): part of Organization schema, links to type Address\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere does fabio aurelio play?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cpdl2 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cpdl2 fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team ?x .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2015-08-10\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2015-08-10\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nF\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio, also known as Fabio Aurelio, F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio Rodrigues (fb:m.0cpdl2): F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio Rodrigues is a Brazilian former footballer who pla...at Under-17 and Under-20 levels and at the 2000 Sydney Olympics., has type Football player\n\nUsing properties:\nTeams (fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams): links to type Sports team roster, part of Athlete schema\nFrom (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.from): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Date/Time\nTeam (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Sports Team\nTo (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.to): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Date/Time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat books has elie wiesel written?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02vsp ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02vsp fb:book.author.book_editions_published ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nElie Wiesel, also known as Eliezer \"Elie\" Wiesel, Eliezer Wiesel (fb:m.02vsp): Eliezer \"Elie\" Wiesel KBE is a Romanian-born Jewish writer, prof...ful message \"of peace, atonement and human dignity\" to humanity., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nBook editions published (fb:book.author.book_editions_published): links to type Book Edition, part of Author schema", "tool_call_id": "1c17176d8f964a1c893fdc0bd726a091"}, {"content": "I have seen examples where we find entities and their related properties to answer questions.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did michael j fox marry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "3f13c07187354e50807db49b295fa85d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat planet was luke skywalker raised on?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f1bg ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f1bg fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLuke Skywalker (fb:m.0f1bg): Luke Skywalker is a fictional character appearing as the central...e Awakens, which is planned to be released on December 18, 2015., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nPlaces lived (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Setting\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho does dominic monaghan play in lord of the rings?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01kwld ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01kwld fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film fb:m.017jd9 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, also known as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: Extended Edition, The Return of the King (fb:m.017jd9): The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 epic fan...ce in which Sauron created it: the volcanic fires of Mount Doom., has type Film\nDominic Monaghan, also known as Dom, Dominic Bernard Patrick Luke Monaghan (fb:m.01kwld): Dominic Monaghan is an English actor.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what degrees does romney have?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "15e061af2e104aacbecbf5ef26f8bac6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat countries did queen victoria rule?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cw10 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cw10 fb:government.political_appointer.appointees ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nQueen Victoria, also known as Victoria, Alexandrina Victoria, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, Princess Alexandrina Victoria, H.M.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who does mila kunis play on family guy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "179dcc64136a47f5a7a206985da68e14", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat was basketball player michael jordan's major in college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.054c1 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.054c1 fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.major_field_of_study ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Jordan, also known as MJ, His Airness, Mike Jordan, Michael Jeffrey Jordan, His Royal Airness (fb:m.054c1): Michael Jeffrey Jordan, also known by his initials, MJ, is an Am...ation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nMajor/Field Of Study (fb:education.education.major_field_of_study): links to type Field of study, part of Education schema\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere's the hudson river?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cvyp ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cvyp fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHudson River, also known as Great Mohegan (fb:m.0cvyp): The Hudson River is a 315-mile river that flows from north to so...pper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary., has type River\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does maggie grace play in taken?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03mgx6z ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03mgx6z fb:film.film.starring ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.03_wpf .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMaggie Grace, also known as Miss America, \u041c\u044d\u0433\u0433\u0438 \u0413\u0440\u044d\u0439\u0441, Margaret Grace Denig, Maggie Graceless (fb:m.03_wpf): Margaret Grace Denig, known professionally as Maggie Grace, is a... in Taken in 2008.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who played bilbo in the fellowship of the ring?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "13a9f25b0678444eb5ccc38ba001d19d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho owns the cleveland browns?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01xvb ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01xvb fb:sports.professional_sports_team.owner_s ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCleveland Browns (fb:m.01xvb): The Cleveland Browns are a professional American football franch...ver won another championship or even appeared in the Super Bowl., has type Professional Sports Team\n\nUsing properties:\nOwner(s) (fb:sports.professional_sports_team.owner_s): part of Professional Sports Team schema, links to type Sports Team Owner\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere is the great pyramid of giza situated?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.036mk ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.036mk fb:architecture.building.building_complex ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGreat Pyramid of Giza, also known as Khufu's Horizon, Pyramid of Khufu, Pyramid of Cheops (fb:m.036mk): The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three... place.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is nineveh city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2ec0e4b587d14886be5a1e2985895958", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhen did kerry run for president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d3qd0 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d3qd0 fb:government.politician.election_campaigns ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn Kerry, also known as Sen.

It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what religions are popular in france?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "32b18d568af448a3956bc9d3f4faabc4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the local language of israel?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03spz ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03spz fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIsrael, also known as State of Israel (fb:m.03spz): Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in Western ...itish Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do people speak in costa rica?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01p8s ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01p8s fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCosta Rica, also known as Republic of Costa Rica (fb:m.01p8s): Costa Rica, officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country ...orld as of 2012, among the highest of any Latin American nation., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho speaks arabic language?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jzc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jzc fb:language.human_language.main_country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nArabic Language, also known as \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a, /m/0jzc, Arabic (fb:m.0jzc): Arabic /\u02c8\u00e6r\u0259b\u026ak/ is the Classical Arabic language of the 6th cen...her as a single language for political and/or religious reasons., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nMain Country (fb:language.human_language.main_country): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country", "tool_call_id": "32b18d568af448a3956bc9d3f4faabc4"}, {"content": "From the examples, we see that countries are represented as entities and properties link countries to languages or other attributes.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what honor did agatha christie receive in 1971?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "bb76058232694f07ba73975a8de8852b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is phoebe halliwell's real name?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01ymly ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01ymly fb:tv.tv_character.appeared_in_tv_episodes ?y .\n  ?y fb:tv.tv_guest_role.actor ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPhoebe Halliwell (fb:m.01ymly): Phoebe Halliwell is a fictional character from the television se...ng her destiny of defeating the forces of evil in San Francisco., has type TV Character\n\nUsing properties:\nAppeared In TV Episodes (fb:tv.tv_character.appeared_in_tv_episodes): links to type TV episode performance, part of TV Character schema\nActor (fb:tv.tv_guest_role.actor): part of TV episode performance schema, links to type TV Actor\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the best currency to take to egypt 2013?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02k54 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02k54 fb:location.country.currency_used ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEgypt, also known as Arab Republic of Egypt (fb:m.02k54): Egypt, officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinen...ater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities in the Nile Delta., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nCurrency Used (fb:location.country.currency_used): links to type Currency, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does christine gregoire represent?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03mfmb ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03mfmb fb:government.politician.government_positions_held ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.office_position_or_title ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChristine Gregoire (fb:m.03mfmb): Christine O'Grady Gregoire is an American politician who served ...lly Jewell was nominated for the position of Interior Secretary., has type Politician\n\nUsing properties:\nOffice, position, or title (fb:government.government_position_held.office_position_or_title): links to type Government Office or Title, part of Government Position Held schema\nGovernment Positions Held (fb:government.politician.government_positions_held): links to type Government Position Held, part of Politician schema", "tool_call_id": "bb76058232694f07ba73975a8de8852b"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that to find honors or awards received by a person in a specific year, I should first identify the entity for the person and then look for properties related to honors, awards, or recognitions.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is the president of peru now?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "6fa3e8abbd2d44058995ebbb8c927636", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho has played edward quartermaine on general hospital?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0358x_ ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0358x_ fb:tv.tv_program.regular_cast ?y .\n  ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.actor ?x .\n  ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.character fb:m.026plrr .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEdward Quartermaine (fb:m.026plrr): Edward Louis Quartermaine is a fictional character from the ABC ...6, he portrayed Edward up until his death on September 16, 2012., has type TV Character\nGeneral Hospital (fb:m.0358x_): General Hospital is an American daytime television medical drama...ally set it in a general hospital, in an unnamed fictional city., has type TV Program\n\nUsing properties:\nActor (fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.actor): part of TV Regular Performance schema, links to type TV Actor\nCharacter (fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.character): part of TV Regular Performance schema, links to type TV Character\nRegular acting performances (fb:tv.tv_program.regular_cast): links to type TV Regular Performance, part of TV Program schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat currency does the dominican republic?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.027rn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.027rn fb:location.country.currency_used ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDominican Republic, also known as Rep\u00fablica Dominicana (fb:m.027rn): The Dominican Republic is a country on the island of Hispaniola,...y removed by the Haitian government and Dominican slave revolts., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nCurrency Used (fb:location.country.currency_used): links to type Currency, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat do costa ricans speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01p8s ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01p8s fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCosta Rica, also known as Republic of Costa Rica (fb:m.01p8s): Costa Rica, officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country ...orld as of 2012, among the highest of any Latin American nation., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema", "tool_call_id": "6fa3e8abbd2d44058995ebbb8c927636"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that countries are represented as entities and properties related to countries can be used to find specific information.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what country was king tut's tomb found?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e749d17d35c74c4f9c29ac707e2430e6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is tom cruise from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07r1h ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07r1h fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTom Cruise, also known as Thomas \"Tom\" Cruise Mapother IV, Tomu Kur\u00fbzu, Tom, Thomas Mapother IV, Thomas Cruise Mapother IV (fb:m.07r1h): Tom Cruise is an American actor and filmmaker.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what college did joakim noah?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5145d693925346a896e711233e91cf78", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho did michael vick play for in 2008?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.027f42 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.027f42 fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team ?x .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2008-12-31\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2008-01-01\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Vick, also known as Michael Dwayne Vick, The People's Champ, Ookie (fb:m.027f42): Michael Dwayne Vick is an American football quarterback who is c...21 months in prison, followed by two months in home confinement., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nTeams (fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams): links to type Sports team roster, part of Athlete schema\nFrom (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.from): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Date/Time\nTeam (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Sports Team\nTo (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.to): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Date/Time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere was avril lavigne born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0161c2 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0161c2 fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAvril Lavigne, also known as Avril, Avril Ramona Lavigne, Avril Lavinge (fb:m.0161c2): Avril Ramona Lavigne is a Canadian-French singer and songwriter....d 200, eventually selling more than 10 million copies worldwide., has type Musical Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat does annie leibovitz do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.015m2c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.015m2c fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAnnie Leibovitz, also known as Anna-Lou \"Annie\" Leibovitz, Anna-Lou Leibovitz, Annie Leibowitz (fb:m.015m2c): Anna-Lou \"Annie\" Leibovitz is an American portrait photographer., has type Visual Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nProfession (fb:people.person.profession): links to type Profession, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "5145d693925346a896e711233e91cf78"}, {"content": "The examples show that to answer a question about a person's attribute, we first need to find the entity representing the person and then find the relevant property for the attribute.\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"Joakim Noah\" in the knowledge graph.\nStep 2: Search for properties related to education or college for the entity \"Joakim Noah.\"\nStep 3: Construct a SPARQL query to get the college Joakim Noah attended.\n\nI will start by searching for the entity \"Joakim Noah.\"", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"Joakim Noah\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_6erxk8jpko8hmkUy33pwe1t2", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is rick scott?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "fdfedbcea09a41a79dc1438a75340e55", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did roald dahl write?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0ff2k ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0ff2k fb:film.writer.film ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRoald Dahl, also known as Dahl, Roald, Roald Dal, Ronald Dahl (fb:m.0ff2k): Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, poet, scr...Adult works include Tales of the Unexpected and My Uncle Oswald., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm writing credits (fb:film.writer.film): part of Film writer schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat school does bart simpson go to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0h6cb ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0h6cb fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.education ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBart Simpson, also known as Bart 2, Bartholomew Jo-Jo Simpson, Bartholomew J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what kind of products does nike sell?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "59c34533002545e6b46bbc3fd2cbebdd", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is jack daniels factory?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.021zmy ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.021zmy fb:distilled_spirits.distillery.region ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJack Daniel's, also known as Alcoholic beverage, distilled, whiskey, 86 proof, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey (fb:m.021zmy): Jack Daniel's is a brand of Tennessee whiskey and the highest se...uct were sold in the company's fiscal year ended April 30, 2013., has type Brand\n\nUsing properties:\nRegion (fb:distilled_spirits.distillery.region): links to type Spirit-producing region, part of Distillery schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat countries are in the caribbean?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0261m ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0261m fb:location.location.contains ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01mp .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCountry, also known as Empire (fb:m.01mp): The type country in Freebase can and should be used with a varie...s with little population or autonomy will be typed as a country.\nCaribbean, also known as carribean, West Indies, West Indian (fb:m.0261m): The Caribbean is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, it...s composed of five states, all of which were Dutch dependencies., has type Region\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nContains (fb:location.location.contains): part of Location schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat country was the treaty of versailles written?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07d4d ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07d4d fb:time.event.locations ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTreaty of Versailles (fb:m.07d4d): The Treaty of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the en...tal cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion Marks., has type Event\n\nUsing properties:\nLocation(s) (fb:time.event.locations): links to type Location, part of Event schema", "tool_call_id": "59c34533002545e6b46bbc3fd2cbebdd"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query for types of products or related entities for a given brand or company.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who plays roxanne in ghost rider?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5fc8b8f7dc3c4bb2b2a8e1e4338ef018", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhen last did real madrid win the champions league?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06l22 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06l22 fb:sports.sports_team.championships ?x .\n  ?x fb:sports.sports_championship_event.championship fb:m.05nblxt .\n  ?x fb:time.event.end_date ?sk0 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk0 ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nUEFA Champions League Final (fb:m.05nblxt): has type Sports League Championship\nReal Madrid C.F., also known as Real Madrid, Sociedad Madrid FC, Royal Madrid Football Club, Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol, Real Madrid C.F. in European football (fb:m.06l22): Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol, commonly known as Real Madrid, or si... with Barcelona and the El Derbi madrile\u00f1o with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid., has type Football team\n\nUsing properties:\nChampionship (fb:sports.sports_championship_event.championship): part of Sports League Championship Event schema, links to type Sports League Championship\nChampionships (fb:sports.sports_team.championships): links to type Sports League Championship Event, part of Sports Team schema\nEnd date (fb:time.event.end_date): links to type Date/Time, part of Event schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of government does israel?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03spz ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03spz fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIsrael, also known as State of Israel (fb:m.03spz): Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in Western ...itish Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nForm of Government (fb:location.country.form_of_government): links to type Form of Government, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of government did benito mussolini have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0177g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0177g fb:government.politician.party ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.political_party_tenure.party ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenito Mussolini, also known as Mussolini, Iron Prefect, Il Duce, Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (fb:m.0177g): Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was an Italian politician, jour... history until the appointment of Matteo Renzi in February 2014., has type Military Commander\n\nUsing properties:\nParty (fb:government.political_party_tenure.party): part of Political Party Tenure schema, links to type Political party\nParty (fb:government.politician.party): links to type Political Party Tenure, part of Politician schema", "tool_call_id": "5fc8b8f7dc3c4bb2b2a8e1e4338ef018"}, {"content": "To answer the question \"Who plays Roxanne in Ghost Rider?\" we need to identify the entity for the movie \"Ghost Rider\" and the character \"Roxanne\" in that movie.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what year did houston rockets win their first championship?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d7c3656dd5ef4bf8975997ff8c4aaf7f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is madeira?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.04_z1 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.04_z1 fb:location.administrative_division.country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMadeira, also known as Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma da Madeira (PT), Madeira Islands, Regi\u00e3o Aut\u00f3noma Da Madeira, Regiao Autonoma Da Madeira, P\u00e9rola do Atl\u00e2ntico (fb:m.04_z1): Madeira is a Portuguese archipelago located in the north Atlanti...ssified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and embroidery artisans., has type Administrative Division\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.administrative_division.country): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language does people in thailand speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07f1x ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07f1x fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThailand, also known as Siam, Kingdom of Thailand (fb:m.07f1x): Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, formerly known as ...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is president of israel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a594242efd264cbcb84ca9b2b40dc3f4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did doc holliday die from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01rl_m ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01rl_m fb:people.deceased_person.cause_of_death ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDoc Holliday, also known as John Henry Holliday (fb:m.01rl_m): John Henry \"Doc\" Holliday was an American gambler, gunfighter, d...rp was maimed by hidden assailants and Morgan Earp was murdered., has type Person Or Being In Fiction\n\nUsing properties:\nCause of death (fb:people.deceased_person.cause_of_death): part of Deceased Person schema, links to type Cause Of Death\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat was the title of the first book dr. seuss wrote?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02g3w ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02g3w fb:book.author.works_written ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01xryvm .\n  ?x fb:book.written_work.copyright_date ?sk0 .\n}\nORDER BY xsd:datetime ( ?sk0 )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nBook (fb:m.01xryvm): A book is a written work or a collection of written works in boo...For more information, please see the Freebase wiki page on book.\nTheodore Lesieg, also known as Theodore Sieg, Theodor Geisel, Theodor Seuss Geisel, Theodor S.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did veronica lake mary?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "6b90e341b96447f583a9797291c8e130", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is usc from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03tw2s ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03tw2s fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUniversity of South Carolina, also known as Carolina, USC, University of South Carolina, main campus, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC (fb:m.03tw2s): The University of South Carolina is a public, co-educational res...oral degrees from fourteen degree-granting colleges and schools., has type College/University\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat year were the new york yankees established?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cqt41 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cqt41 fb:sports.sports_team.founded ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNew York Yankees, also known as The Pinstripes, The Bronx Bombers, The Pinstripers, The Bronx Zoo, New York Highlanders (fb:m.0cqt41): The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball team based in t...d in 1995, which allowed  the two teams to meet in the playoffs., The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team ... attendance\u2014in 2011, the Yankees had the 2nd-highest attendance., has type Professional Sports Team\n\nUsing properties:\nFounded (fb:sports.sports_team.founded): part of Sports Team schema, links to type Date/Time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat college did russell wilson go to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05c10yf ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05c10yf fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCollege/University, also known as College, University (fb:m.01y2hnl): The College/University type is used for institutions that offer ...mation, please see the Freebase wiki page on College/University.\nRussell Wilson (fb:m.05c10yf): Russell Carrington Wilson is an American football quarterback fo...econd highest rated NFL passer of all time behind Aaron Rodgers., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "6b90e341b96447f583a9797291c8e130"}, {"content": "The question is \"Who did Veronica Lake marry?\" We need to find the entity for Veronica Lake and then find the property related to marriage or spouse.\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"Veronica Lake\" in the Freebase knowledge graph.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"Veronica Lake\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_Xa7dNkduRxCVAE88hQeRg7w3", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where was benjamin franklin educated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "071ddb625dd5452a9e2c8176a92914e6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat teams are in the american league west?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07fbnf ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07fbnf fb:sports.sports_league.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_league_participation.team ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAmerican League West (fb:m.07fbnf): The American League West is one of three divisions in Major Leag...ivisions an equal five teams and both leagues an equal 15 teams., has type Baseball Division\n\nUsing properties:\nTeams (fb:sports.sports_league.teams): links to type Sports league participation, part of Sports Association schema\nTeam (fb:sports.sports_league_participation.team): part of Sports league participation schema, links to type Sports Team\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat main language do they speak in brazil?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.015fr ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.015fr fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBrazil, also known as Brasil, Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil, Federative Republic of Brazil, Brazilian  (fb:m.015fr): Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the lar...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was the name of henry viii first wife?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "091bb67bd5984774a69a50ac61edb29c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat disease michael jackson?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.09889g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.09889g fb:medicine.notable_person_with_medical_condition.condition ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Jackson, also known as Mike, Applehead, MJ, Smelly, Space Michael (fb:m.09889g): Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 \u2013 June 25, 2009) was an ...l Francis Admire Michael Jackson As His Best.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is the state governor of florida?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e30bedd68cfc44b28a12f170e9d09e9c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat do people from guam speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.034tl ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.034tl fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGuam (fb:m.034tl): Guam is an organized, unincorporated territory of the United Sta...was the only U.S.-held island in the region before World War II., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere north dakota located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05fky ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05fky fb:base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.administrative_parent ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNorth Dakota, also known as ND, N Dak, Peace Garden State (fb:m.05fky): North Dakota is the 39th state of the United States, having been...s driven strong job and population growth, and low unemployment., has type US State\n\nUsing properties:\nAdministrative parent (fb:base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.administrative_parent): part of Administrative Area schema, links to type Administrative Area\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is university of auburn?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01wdj_ ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01wdj_ fb:organization.organization.headquarters ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.mailing_address.state_province_region ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAuburn University, also known as Auburn University, main campus, AU (fb:m.01wdj_): Auburn University is a public university located in Auburn, Alab...nic Institute in 1899, largely because of Dr. Broun's influence., has type College/University\n\nUsing properties:\nState/Province/Region (fb:location.mailing_address.state_province_region): links to type Administrative Division, part of Address schema\nHeadquarters (fb:organization.organization.headquarters): part of Organization schema, links to type Address", "tool_call_id": "e30bedd68cfc44b28a12f170e9d09e9c"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that for states like North Dakota, the entity representing the state can be identified and then properties related to administrative roles or persons can be queried.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.
