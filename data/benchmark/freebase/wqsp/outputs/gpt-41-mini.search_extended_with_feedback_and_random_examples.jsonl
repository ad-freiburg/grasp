Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when does ziva start on ncis?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "273c3a0dc15d4f4da98ffc8572b61992", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat language does the country italy speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03rjj ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03rjj fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItaly, also known as Italia, Italian Republic (fb:m.03rjj): Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamenta...uch as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Michelangelo and Machiavelli., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was michael jackson in the wiz?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.09889g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.09889g fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film fb:m.027fwmt .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Wiz (fb:m.027fwmt): The Wiz is a 1978 American musical adventure film produced in co...aptation of Charlie Smalls and Luther Vandross's songs for film., has type Award-Winning Work\nMichael Jackson, also known as Mike, Applehead, MJ, Smelly, Space Michael (fb:m.09889g): Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 \u2013 June 25, 2009) was an ...l Francis Admire Michael Jackson As His Best.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when did tony romo got drafted?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "9de3b71e4b5a4f92b71feb54a0f0be53", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did julia roberts won an oscar for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  fb:m.046zh fb:award.award_winner.awards_won ?y .\n  ?y fb:award.award_honor.honored_for ?x .\n  ?y fb:award.award_honor.award ?awd .\n  ?awd fb:award.award_category.category_of fb:m.0g_w .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJulia Roberts, also known as Jules, Julia Fiona Roberts, Roberts, Julia (fb:m.046zh): Julia Fiona Roberts is an American actress and producer.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what voices does seth macfarlane play on family guy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "38d079b417f44787855ff70d47229aaa", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of aircraft does virgin america use?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03bwrn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03bwrn fb:aviation.aircraft_owner.aircraft_fleet_composition ?y .\n  ?y fb:aviation.aircraft_ownership_count.aircraft_model ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nVirgin America (fb:m.03bwrn): Virgin America, Inc. is a United States-based airline that began...ion to work with any companies that share the Virgin brand name., has type Airline\n\nUsing properties:\nAircraft Fleet Composition (fb:aviation.aircraft_owner.aircraft_fleet_composition): links to type Aircraft Ownership Count, part of Aircraft Owner schema\nAircraft Model (fb:aviation.aircraft_ownership_count.aircraft_model): part of Aircraft Ownership Count schema, links to type Aircraft model\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did adam sandler married?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0pz91 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0pz91 fb:people.person.spouse_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.spouse ?x .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.type_of_union fb:m.04ztj .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarriage, also known as Matrimony, Wedlock (fb:m.04ztj): Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or rit...of concerns for women's rights and because of international law., has type Religious Practice\nAdam Sandler, also known as Adam Richard Sandler, Sandman (fb:m.0pz91): Adam Richard Sandler is an American actor, comedian, screenwrite...developed the 2007 television sitcom series Rules of Engagement., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nSpouse (fb:people.marriage.spouse): part of Marriage schema, links to type Person\nType of union (fb:people.marriage.type_of_union): links to type Marriage/union type, part of Marriage schema\nSpouse (or domestic partner) (fb:people.person.spouse_s): links to type Marriage, part of Person schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is south carolina located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06yxd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06yxd fb:location.administrative_division.country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSouth Carolina, also known as Palmetto State, SC (fb:m.06yxd): South Carolina /\u02ccsa\u028a\u03b8 k\u00e6r\u0259\u02c8la\u026an\u0259/ is a state in the southeastern...rson-Mauldin metropolitan area had a 2013 population of 850,965., has type US State\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.administrative_division.country): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country", "tool_call_id": "38d079b417f44787855ff70d47229aaa"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly relate to actors or voice roles, so I will now search for the entity \"Seth MacFarlane\" in the Freebase knowledge graph to find his identifier.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was the title of the book charles darwin wrote?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "9f02a2dffc1c4b4ab823221734749fbe", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat zip code is chicago il?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01_d4 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01_d4 fb:location.citytown.postal_codes ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChicago, also known as Chicago, Chicagoland, The Windy City, The City With Broad Shoulders, The City That Works, DuPage County / Chicago city (fb:m.01_d4): Chicago is the third most populous city in the United States.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what team did jackie robinson?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "05c78b1c9e50406ab70060152e949d2e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat do do in nashville tn?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05jbn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05jbn fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNashville, also known as Nashville, Tennessee, Nashville, TN (fb:m.05jbn): Nashville is the capital of the U.S. state of Tennessee and the ...the semi-independent municipalities, the population was 634,464., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho plays lola bunny on the looney tunes show?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0534r8 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0534r8 fb:tv.tv_character.appeared_in_tv_program ?y .\n  ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.actor ?x .\n  ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.series fb:m.03q4kg .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBaby Looney Tunes (fb:m.03q4kg): Baby Looney Tunes is a Canadian animated television series showi...Muppet Babies, with the main characters taken care of by Granny., has type TV Program\nLola Bunny (fb:m.0534r8): Lola Bunny is a Looney Tunes cartoon character portrayed as an a...t\" to Bugs Bunny.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did tim tebow grow up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "05ce82ccc20d413ab584fe08e110c68e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho was judy garland married to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0g10g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0g10g fb:people.person.spouse_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.spouse ?x .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.type_of_union fb:m.04ztj .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarriage, also known as Matrimony, Wedlock (fb:m.04ztj): Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or rit...of concerns for women's rights and because of international law., has type Religious Practice\nJudy Garland, also known as The Garland Sisters, Miss Show Business, Marie Gumm, Judy, Joots (fb:m.0g10g): Judy Garland was an American singer, actress, and vaudevillian. ...urn to acting, beginning with critically acclaimed performances., has type Musical Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nSpouse (fb:people.marriage.spouse): part of Marriage schema, links to type Person\nType of union (fb:people.marriage.type_of_union): links to type Marriage/union type, part of Marriage schema\nSpouse (or domestic partner) (fb:people.person.spouse_s): links to type Marriage, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat dialects are spoken in the uk?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07ssc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07ssc fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited Kingdom, also known as United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, United Kingdom of Great Britain, UK, U.K. (fb:m.07ssc): The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, common...urth-largest in Europe and second-largest in the European Union., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat did edward jenner do for a living?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02ljb ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02ljb fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEdward Jenner (fb:m.02ljb): Edward Jenner, FRS was an English physician and scientist who wa...the first person to describe the brood parasitism of the cuckoo., has type Academic\n\nUsing properties:\nProfession (fb:people.person.profession): links to type Profession, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "05ce82ccc20d413ab584fe08e110c68e"}, {"content": "The examples show how to find information about a person using their Freebase entity and relevant properties.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the supreme court cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1ba61bd33ad9430b985dd2b797d2076c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of government does chile have today?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01p1v ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01p1v fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChile, also known as Republic of Chile (fb:m.01p1v): Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American cou...nth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nForm of Government (fb:location.country.form_of_government): links to type Form of Government, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is the west bank located in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.082pc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.082pc fb:location.administrative_division.country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nWest Bank (fb:m.082pc): The West Bank Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u200e a\u1e0d-\u1e0ciffah l-\u0120arbiyyah; Hebr...m, illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this., has type Administrative Division\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.administrative_division.country): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat else did eli whitney invent?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02ncr ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02ncr fb:law.inventor.inventions ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEli Whitney (fb:m.02ncr): Eli Whitney was an American inventor best known for inventing th...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where were greek temples built?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "0d4632b246bd4cd6b1f6fcac4ec5f91c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat's jamaica country code?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03_r3 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03_r3 fb:base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.short_name ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJamaica (fb:m.03_r3): Jamaica is an island country situated in the Caribbean Sea, comp...d Canada, and the fourth most populous country in the Caribbean., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nShort name (fb:base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.short_name): part of Administrative Area schema, links to type Text\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat planet was luke skywalker raised on?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f1bg ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f1bg fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLuke Skywalker (fb:m.0f1bg): Luke Skywalker is a fictional character appearing as the central...e Awakens, which is planned to be released on December 18, 2015., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nPlaces lived (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Setting\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is beside france?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f8l9c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f8l9c fb:location.location.adjoin_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.adjoining_relationship.adjoins ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01mp .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCountry, also known as Empire (fb:m.01mp): The type country in Freebase can and should be used with a varie...s with little population or autonomy will be typed as a country.\nFrance, also known as French Republic, R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise, l'Hexagone (fb:m.0f8l9c): France, officially the French Republic, is a sovereign state com...g and paving the way for a future centralized absolute monarchy., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nAdjoins (fb:location.adjoining_relationship.adjoins): part of Adjoining Relationship schema, links to type Location\nAdjoins (fb:location.location.adjoin_s): links to type Adjoining Relationship, part of Location schema", "tool_call_id": "0d4632b246bd4cd6b1f6fcac4ec5f91c"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly relate to Greek temples or their locations.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what year was george w bush elected?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ad246f96e52a4d24bde938978724f4f4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did roald dahl write?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0ff2k ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0ff2k fb:book.author.works_written ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRoald Dahl, also known as Dahl, Roald, Roald Dal, Ronald Dahl (fb:m.0ff2k): Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, poet, scr...Adult works include Tales of the Unexpected and My Uncle Oswald., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nWorks written (fb:book.author.works_written): links to type Written Work, part of Author schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat office does hillary clinton hold?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d06m5 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d06m5 fb:people.appointee.position ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.appointment.appointed_role ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHillary Rodham Clinton, also known as First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, The First Lady Hillary Clinton, Sen.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what college did se hinton go?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2efd02f4281440918b618be696352106", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the current president of china 2010?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d05w3 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d05w3 fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?x .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.basic_title fb:m.060c4 .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2010-12-31\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2010-01-01\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident, also known as Chairman (fb:m.060c4): A president is the leader of a country or a division or part of ...publics, semi-presidential republics or parliamentary republics., has type Fictional job title\nChina, also known as People's Republic of China (fb:m.0d05w3): China, officially the People's Republic of China, is a sovereign...h-largest by total area, depending on the method of measurement., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nBasic title (fb:government.government_position_held.basic_title): links to type Government office category, part of Government Position Held schema\nFrom (fb:government.government_position_held.from): part of Government Position Held schema, links to type Date/Time\nOfficeholder (fb:government.government_position_held.office_holder): part of Government Position Held schema, links to type Politician\nTo (fb:government.government_position_held.to): part of Government Position Held schema, links to type Date/Time\nGoverning officials (fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials): part of Governmental Jurisdiction schema, links to type Government Position Held\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat movies have adam sandler been in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0pz91 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0pz91 fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAdam Sandler, also known as Adam Richard Sandler, Sandman (fb:m.0pz91): Adam Richard Sandler is an American actor, comedian, screenwrite...developed the 2007 television sitcom series Rules of Engagement., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat county is novato california in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0r1hb ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0r1hb fb:location.hud_county_place.county ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNovato, also known as Novato, California, Marin County / Novato city (fb:m.0r1hb): Novato is a city in northern Marin County, in the North Bay regi...an Rafael and about 30 miles north of San Francisco on U.S. 101., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nCounty (fb:location.hud_county_place.county): part of HUD County Place schema, links to type US County", "tool_call_id": "2efd02f4281440918b618be696352106"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that the approach is to first search for the entity \"se hinton\" and then find the property related to \"college\" or \"education\" to get the college she attended.\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"se hinton\" in the freebase knowledge graph.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"se hinton\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_DFw7ucYBuF0P9cXzZV0QOUbZ", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of king george vi wife?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c2df63836f734a86b0bfa624e715fe5c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat form of government does canada have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0d060g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0d060g fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCanada, also known as Canuckistan, Dominion of Canada (fb:m.0d060g): Canada is a country, consisting of ten provinces and three terri...of provinces and territories to the new self-governing Dominion., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nForm of Government (fb:location.country.form_of_government): links to type Form of Government, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language people speak in afghanistan?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jdd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jdd fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAfghanistan, also known as Afganistan, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (fb:m.0jdd): Afghanistan /\u00e6f\u02c8\u0261\u00e6n\u0268st\u00e6n/, officially the Islamic Republic of Af..., Hotaks, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of language do irish speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03bkbh ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03bkbh fb:people.ethnicity.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIrish people, also known as Irish (fb:m.03bkbh): The Irish people are a nation and ethnic group who originate fro...an to set foot on American soil in Columbus' expedition of 1492., has type Ethnicity\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:people.ethnicity.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Ethnicity schema", "tool_call_id": "c2df63836f734a86b0bfa624e715fe5c"}, {"content": "The question is about the wife of King George VI.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who does alyson stoner play in camp rock?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1c00a721323d4c20a9f259ac684ce006", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the government structure of germany?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0345h ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0345h fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGermany, also known as Deutschland, Federal Republic of Germany, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, BRD (fb:m.0345h): Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federa...9, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nForm of Government (fb:location.country.form_of_government): links to type Form of Government, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat airport is closest to cancun?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01q98m ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01q98m fb:location.location.nearby_airports ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCanc\u00fan, also known as Cancun (fb:m.01q98m): Canc\u00fan is a city in southeastern Mexico, located on the northeas...guage documents, the city\u2019s name is sometimes spelled \"Cancoon\"., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nNearby airports (fb:location.location.nearby_airports): part of Location schema, links to type Airport\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is the boeing company?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0178g ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0178g fb:organization.organization.headquarters ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.mailing_address.citytown ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBoeing, also known as The Boeing Company (fb:m.0178g): The Boeing Company is an American multinational corporation that...t, and ranked 27th on the \"World's Most Admired Companies\" list., has type Organization founder\n\nUsing properties:\nCity/Town (fb:location.mailing_address.citytown): links to type Location, part of Address schema\nHeadquarters (fb:organization.organization.headquarters): part of Organization schema, links to type Address", "tool_call_id": "1c00a721323d4c20a9f259ac684ce006"}, {"content": "The question is about the character Alyson Stoner plays in the movie Camp Rock.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did michael j fox marry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "8512f5447d8040fe9a7ec88130870322", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat planet was luke skywalker raised on?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f1bg ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f1bg fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLuke Skywalker (fb:m.0f1bg): Luke Skywalker is a fictional character appearing as the central...e Awakens, which is planned to be released on December 18, 2015., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nPlaces lived (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.places_lived): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Setting\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho does dominic monaghan play in lord of the rings?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01kwld ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01kwld fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film fb:m.017jd9 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, also known as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King: Extended Edition, The Return of the King (fb:m.017jd9): The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a 2003 epic fan...ce in which Sauron created it: the volcanic fires of Mount Doom., has type Film\nDominic Monaghan, also known as Dom, Dominic Bernard Patrick Luke Monaghan (fb:m.01kwld): Dominic Monaghan is an English actor.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what degrees does romney have?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "108a2cb52b8547aabe3c8b3af03283c9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat countries did queen victoria rule?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cw10 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cw10 fb:government.political_appointer.appointees ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nQueen Victoria, also known as Victoria, Alexandrina Victoria, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, Princess Alexandrina Victoria, H.M.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who plays nicholas newman on the young and the restless?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "dd478fb0dc6e4509b5dc0db60fa8e5b7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho does leia think her father is?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0ddqw ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0ddqw fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.parents ?x .\n  ?x fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.gender fb:m.05zppz .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMale, also known as Men, Man, Guy, Dude, Boy (fb:m.05zppz): A male organism is the physiological sex that produces sperm.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is mitt romney's family from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2190eeaab90342d599812fc8c37ad347", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere was the vietnam war located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07_nf ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07_nf fb:time.event.locations ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nVietnam War, also known as American War, Vietnam Conflict, Second Indochina War (fb:m.07_nf): The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War, and als... operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes., has type Military Conflict\n\nUsing properties:\nLocation(s) (fb:time.event.locations): links to type Location, part of Event schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat does duffy sing?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03h3y8v ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03h3y8v fb:music.artist.track ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDuffy, also known as Aim\u00e9e Ann Duffy, Aimee Anne Duffy, Aim\u00e9e Anne Duffy (fb:m.03h3y8v): Aimee Ann Duffy, known as Duffy, is a Welsh singer, songwriter a...nded hiatus from music before beginning work on her third album., has type Musical Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nRecordings (fb:music.artist.track): links to type Musical Recording, part of Musical Artist schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho did lenny kravitz marry?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0161sp ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0161sp fb:people.person.spouse_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.spouse ?x .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.type_of_union fb:m.04ztj .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.to ?sk0 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk0 ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nLenny Kravitz, also known as Romeo Blue (former), Romeo Blue, L.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what city is mt lassen in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "cdadb8114257412fa7651ee37fb8c474", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did barack obama went to school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02mjmr ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02mjmr fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBarack Obama, also known as President Obama, President Barack Obama, President Barack Hussein Obama II, President Barack H.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what religions are popular in france?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5c168d5da16c4621a3fa572289a8fa18", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the local language of israel?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03spz ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03spz fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIsrael, also known as State of Israel (fb:m.03spz): Israel, officially the State of Israel, is a country in Western ...itish Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do people speak in costa rica?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01p8s ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01p8s fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCosta Rica, also known as Republic of Costa Rica (fb:m.01p8s): Costa Rica, officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country ...orld as of 2012, among the highest of any Latin American nation., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho speaks arabic language?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jzc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jzc fb:language.human_language.main_country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nArabic Language, also known as \u0627\u0644\u0644\u063a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629, \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a, /m/0jzc, Arabic (fb:m.0jzc): Arabic /\u02c8\u00e6r\u0259b\u026ak/ is the Classical Arabic language of the 6th cen...her as a single language for political and/or religious reasons., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nMain Country (fb:language.human_language.main_country): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country", "tool_call_id": "5c168d5da16c4621a3fa572289a8fa18"}, {"content": "The examples show queries about languages spoken or official languages in countries, but not directly about religions popular in a country.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is rick scott?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c5748f444c9449edb1c3bc2e0f405b0b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did roald dahl write?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0ff2k ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0ff2k fb:film.writer.film ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRoald Dahl, also known as Dahl, Roald, Roald Dal, Ronald Dahl (fb:m.0ff2k): Roald Dahl was a British novelist, short story writer, poet, scr...Adult works include Tales of the Unexpected and My Uncle Oswald., has type Author\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm writing credits (fb:film.writer.film): part of Film writer schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat school does bart simpson go to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0h6cb ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0h6cb fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.education ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBart Simpson, also known as Bart 2, Bartholomew Jo-Jo Simpson, Bartholomew J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is the city wales?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "97ef6203f7d64756b4e4f2e3efb694ae", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere's wayne state?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01s0_f ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01s0_f fb:organization.organization.headquarters ?y .\n  ?y fb:location.mailing_address.country ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nWayne State University, also known as WSU, Wayne State University, main campus, Wayne State University, Detroit (fb:m.01s0_f): Wayne State University is a public research university located i... and hosting of the Detroit Windsor International Film Festival., has type College/University\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.mailing_address.country): part of Address schema, links to type Country\nHeadquarters (fb:organization.organization.headquarters): part of Organization schema, links to type Address\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat was nicolaus copernicus occupation?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01vvm4 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01vvm4 fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNicolaus Copernicus, also known as Miko\u0142aj Kopernik, Niclas Koppernigk, Nicol\u00f2 Copernico, Nikolaus Kopernikus (fb:m.01vvm4): Nicolaus Copernicus was a Renaissance mathematician and astronom...ormulated a version of what later became known as Gresham's law., has type Astronomer\n\nUsing properties:\nProfession (fb:people.person.profession): links to type Profession, part of Person schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere was dwight d. eisenhower from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.028rk ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.028rk fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDwight D.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did veronica lake mary?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e6793dbd257546c99f9fec94c957715d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is usc from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.03tw2s ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.03tw2s fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUniversity of South Carolina, also known as Carolina, USC, University of South Carolina, main campus, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC (fb:m.03tw2s): The University of South Carolina is a public, co-educational res...oral degrees from fourteen degree-granting colleges and schools., has type College/University\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat year were the new york yankees established?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cqt41 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cqt41 fb:sports.sports_team.founded ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNew York Yankees, also known as The Pinstripes, The Bronx Bombers, The Pinstripers, The Bronx Zoo, New York Highlanders (fb:m.0cqt41): The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball team based in t...d in 1995, which allowed  the two teams to meet in the playoffs., The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team ... attendance\u2014in 2011, the Yankees had the 2nd-highest attendance., has type Professional Sports Team\n\nUsing properties:\nFounded (fb:sports.sports_team.founded): part of Sports Team schema, links to type Date/Time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat college did russell wilson go to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05c10yf ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05c10yf fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCollege/University, also known as College, University (fb:m.01y2hnl): The College/University type is used for institutions that offer ...mation, please see the Freebase wiki page on College/University.\nRussell Wilson (fb:m.05c10yf): Russell Carrington Wilson is an American football quarterback fo...econd highest rated NFL passer of all time behind Aaron Rodgers., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "e6793dbd257546c99f9fec94c957715d"}, {"content": "The question is \"Who did Veronica Lake marry?\" We need to find the entity for Veronica Lake and then find the property related to marriage or spouse.\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"Veronica Lake\" in the knowledge graph.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"Veronica Lake\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_rF417cjoceluRteZa98nTkm4", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what does god shiva represent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "659631fa1e7148449355cf67756f2c4f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat are all the things thomas edison invented?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07bty ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07bty fb:law.inventor.inventions ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThomas Edison, also known as Edison, Thomas, The Wizard of Menlo Park, Thomas A.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "which country was michael jackson born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f9d392347dc546e79f8c202c1f5e0da0", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat college did jerry rice attend?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0240vt ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0240vt fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCollege/University, also known as College, University (fb:m.01y2hnl): The College/University type is used for institutions that offer ...mation, please see the Freebase wiki page on College/University.\nJerry Rice, also known as The man with the hands, Jerry Lee Rice, Gentleman Jerry, Flash 80 (fb:m.0240vt): Jerry Lee Rice is a former American football wide receiver who p...d over 100 NFL records, the most of any player by a wide margin., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat guitar did clapton play?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02qwg ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02qwg fb:music.guitarist.guitars_played ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEric Clapton, also known as eric_clapton, Eric Patrick Clapton, God, Slowhand, Slow Hand (fb:m.02qwg): Eric Patrick Clapton, CBE, is an English rock and blues guitaris...Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" helped reggae reach a mass market., has type Musical Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nGuitars Played (fb:music.guitarist.guitars_played): part of Guitarist schema, links to type Guitar\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat other jobs did benjamin franklin have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.019fz ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.019fz fb:people.person.profession ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as Ben Franklin (fb:m.019fz): Benjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United ...s, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment., Benjamin Franklin (1706  1790) was an inventor, publisher. scien...ng library in America and first fire department in Pennsylvania., has type U.S. Congressperson\n\nUsing properties:\nProfession (fb:people.person.profession): links to type Profession, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "f9d392347dc546e79f8c202c1f5e0da0"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that the entity for a person can be searched by name and the property for birth country or place of birth can be searched or inferred.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is louisiana state senator?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "4be757c4a0ad4cb998cdb32752e072f2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the manager of the st louis cardinals?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06x68 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06x68 fb:baseball.baseball_team.current_manager ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSt. Louis Cardinals, also known as Rally Squirrel, Saint Louis Cardinals, Redbirds, Cards (fb:m.06x68): The St. Louis Cardinals are a professional baseball team based i...n outright in 1886 in a storied rivalry that continues on today., Under the Arch that signifies the Gateway to the American West, ...pionships, nine Division Titles and thirty-seven Hall of Famers., has type Professional Sports Team\n\nUsing properties:\nCurrent Manager (fb:baseball.baseball_team.current_manager): links to type Baseball Manager, part of Baseball Team schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho are the famous athletes in kenya?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.019rg5 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.019rg5 fb:sports.sport_country.athletic_performances ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.competitor_competition_relationship.competitors ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKenya, also known as Republic of Kenya (fb:m.019rg5): Kenya /\u02c8k\u025bnj\u0259/, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country i...hiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nCompetitors (fb:sports.competitor_competition_relationship.competitors): part of Competitor/competition relationship schema, links to type Tournament event competitor\nAthletic performances (fb:sports.sport_country.athletic_performances): links to type Competitor/competition relationship, part of Sport Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere's the hudson river?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0cvyp ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0cvyp fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHudson River, also known as Great Mohegan (fb:m.0cvyp): The Hudson River is a 315-mile river that flows from north to so...pper New York Bay, but he considered the river to be an estuary., has type River\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location", "tool_call_id": "4be757c4a0ad4cb998cdb32752e072f2"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that to find a person with a specific role or position, we need to identify the entity representing Louisiana and the property that links it to its state senators.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what country is nicki minaj from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a3c7268d6c7b4450951d2a805e5db66b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the currency in the republic of congo?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01rxw ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01rxw fb:location.country.currency_used ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCongo, also known as Congo Brazzaville, Congo-Brazzaville, Republic of Congo (fb:m.01rxw): The Republic of the Congo, also known as Congo Republic, West Co...dent Denis Sassou Nguesso has ruled for 26 of the past 36 years., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nCurrency Used (fb:location.country.currency_used): links to type Currency, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere was leonardo da vinci when he died?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.04lg6 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.04lg6 fb:people.deceased_person.place_of_death ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLeonardo da Vinci, also known as Da Vinci, Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, Leonardo DaVinci, Leonardo (fb:m.04lg6): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, April 15, 1452 \u2013 May 2, 1519..., their fame approached only by Michelangelo's Creation of Adamn, Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci, more commonly Leonardo da Vinci,...hat the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time., has type Visual Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nPlace of death (fb:people.deceased_person.place_of_death): part of Deceased Person schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is located university of leeds?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01bzs9 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01bzs9 fb:location.location.containedby ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUniversity of Leeds, also known as Leeds University, University of Leeds, main campus (fb:m.01bzs9): The University of Leeds is a redbrick university located in Leed...outside the top ten British universities by financial endowment., has type College/University\n\nUsing properties:\nContained by (fb:location.location.containedby): part of Location schema, links to type Location", "tool_call_id": "a3c7268d6c7b4450951d2a805e5db66b"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that to find the country a person is from, we need to find the entity for the person and then find a property that links the person to a country.
