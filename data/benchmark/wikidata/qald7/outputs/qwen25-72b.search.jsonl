Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "When was the Battle of Gettysburg?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about when the Battle of Gettysburg took place, we need to identify the entity for the Battle of Gettysburg and then find the date associated with it.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me all books written by Danielle Steel."}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entity for Danielle Steel and then find all the books she has written.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the daughter of Robert Kennedy married to?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the daughter of Robert Kennedy and then find out who she is married to.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the mayor of Tel Aviv?"}, {"content": "To find out who the current mayor of Tel Aviv is, we need to identify the entity for Tel Aviv and then look for the property that indicates the mayor.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me all soccer clubs in Spain."}, {"content": "To find all soccer clubs in Spain, we need to identify the relevant entities and properties in the knowledge graph.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In which films directed by Garry Marshall was Julia Roberts starring?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entities for Garry Marshall and Julia Roberts, and then find the films where Julia Roberts starred and Garry Marshall directed.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which river does the Brooklyn Bridge cross?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about which river the Brooklyn Bridge crosses, we need to identify the entity for the Brooklyn Bridge and then find the property that indicates the river it crosses.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "List all episodes of the first season of the HBO television series The Sopranos."}, {"content": "To list all episodes of the first season of the HBO television series The Sopranos, we need to identify the following:\n1.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me all cities in New Jersey with more than 100000 inhabitants."}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the following elements:\n1.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are tree frogs a type of amphibian?"}, {"content": "To determine if tree frogs are a type of amphibian, we need to find the entity for \"tree frog\" and check if it is classified under the entity for \"amphibian\".
