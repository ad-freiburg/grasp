Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what has shannen doherty played in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c7510d8c8b304e32b52f89c1f6889d22", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what has shannen doherty played in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did regina hall play in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P161 wd:Q235141 ;

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did madonna grew up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "894699a8065b4b989d83828c00568dc3", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"where did madonna grew up?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did rihanna grow up?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q36844 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRihanna, also known as Barbadian singer, Rihana, Robyn Fenty, Robyn Rihanna Fenty (wd:Q36844): Barbadian singer and actress, singer\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did carmen electra grow up?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q185122 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCarmen Electra, also known as Tara Patrick, Tara Leigh Patrick (wd:Q185122): American actress, model, and singer, Playboy Playmate, television actor, voice actor, film actor, dancer, singer, model, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere did neil gaiman grow up?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q210059 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNeil Gaiman, also known as N.

The query returns only descriptions in various languages, which do not answer the question. To answer where Madonna grew up, the query should specifically look for properties related to place of upbringing or childhood residence. Common properties to check include 'place of birth' (P19) or 'residence' (P551), but 'place of birth' is not necessarily where she grew up. Another approach is to check for 'educated at' (P69) or 'hometown' if available. Since Wikidata may not have a direct property for 'grew up in', a good approximation is to check 'place of birth' and 'residence' properties. The current query should be replaced with a targeted query that tries to find these properties and their values for Madonna.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did they find jenni rivera's body?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "37be875826b04207815ac5ec4a12e364", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"where did they find jenni rivera's body?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did reagan die?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9960 wdt:P20 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRonald Reagan, also known as Ronald W Reagan, Ronald W.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where was rihanna raised?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "04514fce446b4489a51d8e37ff5a362e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"where was rihanna raised?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did rihanna grow up?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q36844 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRihanna, also known as Barbadian singer, Rihana, Robyn Fenty, Robyn Rihanna Fenty (wd:Q36844): Barbadian singer and actress, singer\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did rihanna come from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q36844 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRihanna, also known as Barbadian singer, Rihana, Robyn Fenty, Robyn Rihanna Fenty (wd:Q36844): Barbadian singer and actress, singer\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat county is rihanna from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q36844 wdt:P27 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRihanna, also known as Barbadian singer, Rihana, Robyn Fenty, Robyn Rihanna Fenty (wd:Q36844): Barbadian singer and actress, singer\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry of citizenship, also known as subject of (country), nation of citizenship, national of, nationality, nation (wd:P27 as wdt): the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen, country", "tool_call_id": "04514fce446b4489a51d8e37ff5a362e"}, {"content": "From the similar examples, I see that Rihanna is identified as wd:Q36844 in Wikidata.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did ben franklin marry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "77af341fcf9b42ffa27a2e54173a4d4e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"who did ben franklin marry?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere was ben franklin born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as The First American, Silence Dogood, Poor Richard, Ben Franklin, Franklin (wd:Q34969): American polymath and statesman (1706\u20131790), politician, polymath, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did benjamin franklin died?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P20 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as The First American, Silence Dogood, Poor Richard, Ben Franklin, Franklin (wd:Q34969): American polymath and statesman (1706\u20131790), politician, polymath, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of death, also known as POD, location of death, killed in, deathplace, died in (wd:P20 as wdt): most specific known (e.g. city instead of country, or hospital i... city) death location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat jobs did ben franklin do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P106 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as The First American, Silence Dogood, Poor Richard, Ben Franklin, Franklin (wd:Q34969): American polymath and statesman (1706\u20131790), politician, polymath, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\noccupation, also known as job, work, vocation, profession, employment (wd:P106 as wdt): occupation of a person; see also \"field of work\" (Property:P101), \"position held\" (Property:P39)", "tool_call_id": "77af341fcf9b42ffa27a2e54173a4d4e"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that Benjamin Franklin is represented by the entity wd:Q34969 in Wikidata.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what team did aguero play for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c36aa5da38c54c6aa6117b95a6f9c249", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what team did aguero play for?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat team does sergio aguero play for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q119562 wdt:P54 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSergio Ag\u00fcero, also known as Sergio Leonel Ag\u00fcero del Castillo (wd:Q119562): Argentine association football player, association football player, online streamer, businessperson\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as wdt): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat club did aguero play for before man city?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q119562 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P582 ?y .\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 .\n  wd:Q1920 p:P54 ?q .\n  ?q ps:P54 wd:Q50602 ; pq:P580 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ?y <= ?z )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSergio Ag\u00fcero, also known as Sergio Leonel Ag\u00fcero del Castillo (wd:Q119562): Argentine association football player, association football player, online streamer, businessperson\nSamir Nasri (wd:Q1920): French footballer (born 1987), association football player\nassociation football club, also known as association soccer club, F.C., FC, football club, soccer club (wd:Q476028): sports club devoted to association football (soccer)\nManchester City F.C., also known as The Sky Blues, City, The Citizens, The Blues, Sky Blues (wd:Q50602): association football club in Manchester, England\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as ps/p): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat team did kaka play for in 2009?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q531814 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKak\u00e1, also known as Ricardo Kak\u00e1 (wd:Q531814): Brazilian association football player, born 1982, association football player, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as ps/p): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time", "tool_call_id": "c36aa5da38c54c6aa6117b95a6f9c249"}, {"content": "The examples show that the entity for Sergio Ag\u00fcero is wd:Q119562 and the property for \"team played for\" or \"member of sports team\" is wdt:P54.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

However, the use of the electoral district (P768) to identify Pennsylvania senators is not fully accurate because U.S. senators represent entire states, not electoral districts. Instead, the query should filter by the state or the 'state represented' property (P768 is for electoral districts, but for senators, the property 'state represented' (P768) is used, so this is correct but the label filtering might be imprecise). The query uses a label filter with CONTAINS and LCASE, which might cause issues if the label is not exactly 'Pennsylvania' or if there are other entities with similar names. It would be better to directly use the Wikidata item for Pennsylvania (wd:Q140) to ensure accuracy.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the main language used in china?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "9b47d4c10a7a461297d143dae6a5f500", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what is the main language used in china?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the official language in china?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q148 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPeople's Republic of China, also known as Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3, The PRC, RPC, CHN, Red China (wd:Q148): country in East Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of language does china speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q148 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPeople's Republic of China, also known as Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3, The PRC, RPC, CHN, Red China (wd:Q148): country in East Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of language do china speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q148 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPeople's Republic of China, also known as Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3, The PRC, RPC, CHN, Red China (wd:Q148): country in East Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used", "tool_call_id": "9b47d4c10a7a461297d143dae6a5f500"}, {"content": "From the similar examples, the main language used in China can be found using the property \"official language\" (wdt:P37) for the entity \"China\" (wd:Q148).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of airport in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "23b8d176f9d64c009b220966af790220", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what is the name of airport in new york?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat are the airports in chicago?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q1248784 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q1297 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nairport, also known as aerodrome, air port, airports (wd:Q1248784): location where aircraft take off and land with extended support facilities, mostly for commercial air transport\nChicago, also known as The Second City, The Queen of the West, The Windy City, City of Broad Shoulders, City by the Lake (wd:Q1297): city and county seat of Cook County, Illinois, United States of America\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat do do in new york?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q60 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\nNew York City, also known as Capital of the World, Big Apple, the five boroughs, The City So Nice They Named It Twice, NY, NY (wd:Q60): most populous city in the United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is new york in the map?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1384 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNew York, also known as New York state, New York, United States, US-NY, The Empire State, Empire State (wd:Q1384): state of the United States of America\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of", "tool_call_id": "23b8d176f9d64c009b220966af790220"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that airports are instances or subclasses of the entity \"airport\" (wd:Q1248784) and locations can be filtered by the property \"located in the administrative territorial entity\" (wdt:P131).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what currency to take to barbados?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "92c0d987215941d58831cd280a4800a9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what currency to take to barbados?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat currency should i take to jamaica?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q766 wdt:P38 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJamaica, also known as JA, JM, JAM, Commonwealth of Jamaica (wd:Q766): island state in the Caribbean Sea\n\nUsing properties:\ncurrency, also known as base currency, used money (wd:P38 as wdt): currency used by item, uses\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of money to take to bahamas?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q778 wdt:P38 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Bahamas, also known as BAH, Bahama Islands, Bahamas, bs, Commonwealth of the Bahamas (wd:Q778): island sovereign state in the West Indies\n\nUsing properties:\ncurrency, also known as base currency, used money (wd:P38 as wdt): currency used by item, uses\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat currency should i take to mauritius?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1027 wdt:P38 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMauritius, also known as MRI, Republic of Mauritius, MU, Moris, Maurice (wd:Q1027): island sovereign state off of East Africa in the Indian Ocean\n\nUsing properties:\ncurrency, also known as base currency, used money (wd:P38 as wdt): currency used by item, uses", "tool_call_id": "92c0d987215941d58831cd280a4800a9"}, {"content": "From the similar examples, the pattern to find the currency used by a country is to find the entity for the country and then query the property \"currency\" (wdt:P38) for that entity.\n\nStep 1: Find the entity for Barbados.\nStep 2: Query the currency property (wdt:P38) for Barbados.\n\nI will first search for the entity for Barbados.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Barbados\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_unbWuqxfW6QPxW0qN3GiBaKU", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did margaret hoover go to college?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "da2d4260a95a4a779e49d37512203908", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"where did margaret hoover go to college?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did pres clinton go to college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1124 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBill Clinton, also known as William Jefferson Blythe, William Jefferson Blythe III, William Jefferson \"Bill\" Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton, WJC (wd:Q1124): President of the United States from 1993 to 2001, autobiographer, statesperson, saxophonist, politician, governor, diplomat, teacher, jurist, lawyer, writer\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat colleges did alice walker attend?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q215868 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAlice Walker, also known as Alice Walker Leventhal, Alice Malsenior Walker, Alice Malsenior Tallulah-Kate Walker (wd:Q215868): American author and activist, civil rights advocate, short story writer, university teacher, children's writer, climate activist, film producer, screenwriter, educator, novelist, essayist, writer, actor, poet\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere donald trump went to college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q22686 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDonald Trump, also known as President Donald Trump, President Donald J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what can do in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "49e9b1b025b440a69c8df4d9c5cbc506", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what can do in new york?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat do do in new york?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q60 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\nNew York City, also known as Capital of the World, Big Apple, the five boroughs, The City So Nice They Named It Twice, NY, NY (wd:Q60): most populous city in the United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat are some places to visit in new york?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q60 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\nNew York City, also known as Capital of the World, Big Apple, the five boroughs, The City So Nice They Named It Twice, NY, NY (wd:Q60): most populous city in the United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat are historical places in new york?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q1384 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNew York, also known as New York state, New York, United States, US-NY, The Empire State, Empire State (wd:Q1384): state of the United States of America\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "49e9b1b025b440a69c8df4d9c5cbc506"}, {"content": "The examples suggest that to answer \"what can do in New York?\" we can look for tourist attractions or places of interest located in New York City (wd:Q60).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what materials did eduardo paolozzi use in his work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5f78b85006be4c12ad46c76a5cea4865", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what materials did eduardo paolozzi use in his work?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat style of art did henri matisse use?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q5589 wdt:P135 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHenri Matisse, also known as Matisse, Henri-Matisse, H.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what city does fulham play in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "735f39d9f7394f17856f0d605282ee40", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what city does fulham play in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere does the philadelphia union soccer team play?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q689874 wdt:P115 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPhiladelphia Union, also known as The U, Union, PU, Philadelphia (wd:Q689874): Major League Soccer club based in Chester, PA\n\nUsing properties:\nhome venue, also known as home water, venue, stadium, home ground, home field (wd:P115 as wdt): home stadium or venue of a sports team or applicable performing arts organization, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat city is fc schalke 04 in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q32494 wdt:P159 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSchalke 04, also known as FC Gelsenkirchen-Schalke 04, F.C.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who played captain kirk in star trek movie?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ebd60a602ac1424fa15bead61867fe49", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"who played captain kirk in star trek movie?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho played captain kirk in star trek?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?p p:P161 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q16311 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJames T.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what country was stalin in charge of?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ffb1679d3545472488362256d240c5e9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what country was stalin in charge of?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country did truman lead?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q11613 wdt:P39 ?y .\n  ?y wdt:P1001 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHarry S.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was the name of benjamin franklin wife?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "b8037dfb48d74d5f832fe85c93e9ea98", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"what was the name of benjamin franklin wife?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did benjamin franklin died?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q34969 wdt:P20 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as The First American, Silence Dogood, Poor Richard, Ben Franklin, Franklin (wd:Q34969): American polymath and statesman (1706\u20131790), politician, polymath, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of death, also known as POD, location of death, killed in, deathplace, died in (wd:P20 as wdt): most specific known (e.g. city instead of country, or hospital i... city) death location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat was one of benjamin franklin's inventions?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P61 wd:Q34969 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as The First American, Silence Dogood, Poor Richard, Ben Franklin, Franklin (wd:Q34969): American polymath and statesman (1706\u20131790), politician, polymath, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\ndiscoverer or inventor, also known as inventor or discoverer, inventor, invented by, invented, introduced by (wd:P61 as wdt): subject who discovered, first described, invented, or developed this discovery or invention or scientific hypothesis or theory\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat was lincoln's wife's name?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q91 wdt:P26 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAbraham Lincoln, also known as President Lincoln, Uncle Abe, Honest Abe, Abe Lincoln (wd:Q91): president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, military officer, statesperson, postmaster, politician, farmer, writer, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\nspouse, also known as married partner, married to, marry, partner, spouses (wd:P26 as wdt): the subject has the object as their spouse (husband, wife, partn...etc.).
