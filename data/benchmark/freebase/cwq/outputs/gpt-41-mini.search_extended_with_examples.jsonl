Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What University attended by President Kennedy also publishes the periodical journal Princeton Tiger Magazine?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "601833cfe3ec421ebff0d8f64d5f40fc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What University attended by President Kennedy also publishes the periodical journal Princeton Tiger Magazine?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat school is Woodrow Wilson's almamater and publishes Princeton Tiger Magazine?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.083q7 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.083q7 fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:book.periodical_publisher.periodicals_published ?c .\n  ?c fb:book.periodical_publisher_period.periodical fb:m.026_bc .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPrinceton Tiger Magazine (fb:m.026_bc): Princeton Tiger or Tiger Magazine is a college humor magazine published by Princeton University undergraduates since 1882., has type Magazine\nWoodrow Wilson, also known as The Schoolmaster, Wilson, Woodrow, Thomas Woodrow Wilson, The Professor, The Phrasemaker (fb:m.083q7): Thomas Woodrow Wilson was an American politician and academic wh...ve legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933., has type US President\n\nUsing properties:\nPeriodicals Published (fb:book.periodical_publisher.periodicals_published): links to type Periodical Publisher Period, part of Periodical Publisher schema\nPeriodical (fb:book.periodical_publisher_period.periodical): part of Periodical Publisher Period schema, links to type Periodical\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the school that publishes the periodical journal \"Harvard Undergraduate Research Journal\" and that Robert F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What city near the Grand Canyon was an American football player born in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5c0e5bfb9fd0466ab7ff45796fbfe5cb", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What city near the Grand Canyon was an American football player born in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nIn which city does Carlos Santana live that was also the birthplace of an American football player?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01304j ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01304j fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.location.people_born_here ?c .\n  ?c fb:type.object.type fb:american_football.football_player .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAmerican football player (fb:american_football.football_player)\nCarlos Santana, also known as Santana, Carlos, Santana, Mr. Carlos Santana, Devadip Carlos Santana, C.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the college that was founded before 1821 which Charles Drew attended?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "28ea5be0b8d34f0c862afd2177981153", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the college that was founded before 1821 which Charles Drew attended?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat college did Charles Richard Drew go to that has the largest number of undergraduates?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.018t67 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.018t67 fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n  ?x fb:education.university.number_of_undergraduates ?c .\n  ?c fb:measurement_unit.dated_integer.number ?num .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:integer ( ?num ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nCharles R.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who dated the person who said \"heartthrobs are a dime a dozen\"?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "825f1d22534e44c2a277784451026f24", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Who dated the person who said \\\"heartthrobs are a dime a dozen\\\"?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhere is birthplace of the person who said \"Heartthrobs are a dime a dozen\"?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:people.person.quotations fb:m.0jwjc36 .\n  ?c fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHeartthrobs are a dime a dozen (fb:m.0jwjc36): has type Quotation\n\nUsing properties:\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\nQuotations (fb:people.person.quotations): links to type Quotation, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat celebrities have dated the perosn who wrote the lyrics for \"Long Live\"?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:music.lyricist.lyrics_written fb:m.0p72hbz .\n  ?c fb:celebrities.celebrity.sexual_relationships ?y .\n  ?y fb:celebrities.romantic_relationship.celebrity ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLong Live (fb:m.0p72hbz): \"Long Live\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-so...to the top 5 on Billboard Brazil's Brasil Hot 100 Airplay chart., Long Live is a song by Taylor Swift., has type Composition\n\nUsing properties:\nRomantic relationships (with celebrities) (fb:celebrities.celebrity.sexual_relationships): links to type Romantic relationship, part of Celebrity schema\nCelebrity (fb:celebrities.romantic_relationship.celebrity): part of Romantic relationship schema, links to type Celebrity\nLyrics Written (fb:music.lyricist.lyrics_written): links to type Composition, part of Lyricist schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhich celebrities have dated the nominee for the Speak Now World Tour?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:award.award_nominee.award_nominations ?k .\n  ?k fb:award.award_nomination.nominated_for fb:m.0fp_jt_ .\n  ?c fb:celebrities.celebrity.sexual_relationships ?y .\n  ?y fb:celebrities.romantic_relationship.celebrity ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSpeak Now World Tour (fb:m.0fp_jt_): The Speak Now World Tour was the second concert tour by American...oard's annual \"Top 25 Tours\", earning $97 million with 89 shows., has type Award-Nominated Work\n\nUsing properties:\nNominated work (fb:award.award_nomination.nominated_for): links to type Award-Nominated Work, part of Award Nomination schema\nAward Nominations (fb:award.award_nominee.award_nominations): links to type Award Nomination, part of Award Nominee schema\nRomantic relationships (with celebrities) (fb:celebrities.celebrity.sexual_relationships): links to type Romantic relationship, part of Celebrity schema\nCelebrity (fb:celebrities.romantic_relationship.celebrity): part of Romantic relationship schema, links to type Celebrity", "tool_call_id": "825f1d22534e44c2a277784451026f24"}, {"content": "From the examples, it seems that the quote \"heartthrobs are a dime a dozen\" can be represented as a Quotation entity.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What movie featured Taylor Lautner and has an episode run time larger than 22?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2dc9d60ef42b4795b41e3c10358774cc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What movie featured Taylor Lautner and has an episode run time larger than 22?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat show has a running time of more than 22 minutes and starred Taylor Lautner?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07ldhs ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07ldhs fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:tv.tv_program.episode_running_time ?num .\n  FILTER ( xsd:integer ( ?num ) > 22 ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTaylor Lautner, also known as Taylor Daniel Lautner (fb:m.07ldhs): Taylor Daniel Lautner is an American actor, model and martial ar..., Lautner was named the highest-paid teenage actor in Hollywood., has type Martial Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\nOriginal episode running time (fb:tv.tv_program.episode_running_time): part of TV Program schema, links to type Integer\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat movies and TV program episode running time is 22 stared Taylor Lautner?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07ldhs ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07ldhs fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:tv.tv_program.episode_running_time \"22\" .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTaylor Lautner, also known as Taylor Daniel Lautner (fb:m.07ldhs): Taylor Daniel Lautner is an American actor, model and martial ar..., Lautner was named the highest-paid teenage actor in Hollywood., has type Martial Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\nOriginal episode running time (fb:tv.tv_program.episode_running_time): part of TV Program schema, links to type Integer\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat TV show with a run time over 22 minutes has Taylor Lautner been in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07ldhs ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07ldhs fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:tv.tv_program.episode_running_time ?num .\n  FILTER ( xsd:integer ( ?num ) > 22 ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTaylor Lautner, also known as Taylor Daniel Lautner (fb:m.07ldhs): Taylor Daniel Lautner is an American actor, model and martial ar..., Lautner was named the highest-paid teenage actor in Hollywood., has type Martial Artist\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\nOriginal episode running time (fb:tv.tv_program.episode_running_time): part of TV Program schema, links to type Integer", "tool_call_id": "2dc9d60ef42b4795b41e3c10358774cc"}, {"content": "From the examples, it seems Taylor Lautner is identified as fb:m.07ldhs in Freebase.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which residence of Lauren Conrad was the birthplace of Hikaru Sulu?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c95c2e5616f8410eb9f52b19bbd77d1a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which residence of Lauren Conrad was the birthplace of Hikaru Sulu?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthplace of the subject of the film Obama Anak Menteng?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film_subject.films fb:m.0bx_4p9 .\n  ?c fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nObama Anak Menteng, also known as Little Obama (fb:m.0bx_4p9): Obama Anak Menteng is a 2010 biopic drama film written and direc... of the United States, who lived in Indonesia from 1967 to 1971., has type Film\n\nUsing properties:\nFilms On This Subject (fb:film.film_subject.films): part of Film subject schema, links to type Film\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthplace of the person that used to live in Marin City?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:people.person.places_lived ?k .\n  ?k fb:people.place_lived.location fb:m.053myr .\n  ?c fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarin City, also known as Marin City, California (fb:m.053myr): Marin City, is an unincorporated community and census-designated...found celebrity in the 1990s as the home of rapper Tupac Shakur., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\nPlaces lived (fb:people.person.places_lived): links to type Place lived, part of Person schema\nLocation (fb:people.place_lived.location): part of Place lived schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat home of Charlton Heston is the location where a Hall of Fame inductee was born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0chsq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0chsq fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.location.people_born_here ?c .\n  ?c fb:type.object.type fb:award.hall_of_fame_induction .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHall of fame induction (fb:award.hall_of_fame_induction)\nCharlton Heston, also known as John Charles Carter, Chuck, Charlton Easton, Charlie, Captured Slave Charlton Heston (fb:m.0chsq): Charlton Heston was an American actor and political activist.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which schools attended by President Kennedy were founded before 1890?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "3efe73815cdb480a80769fdfdd3aa27c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which schools attended by President Kennedy were founded before 1890?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich college founded before 02-09-1821 did Jackie Kennedy go to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0h6mq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0h6mq fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n  ?x fb:organization.organization.date_founded ?num .\n  FILTER ( ?num < \"1821-02-09\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCollege/University, also known as College, University (fb:m.01y2hnl): The College/University type is used for institutions that offer ...mation, please see the Freebase wiki page on College/University.\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also known as Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, Supertanker, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Onassis, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (fb:m.0h6mq): Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Kennedy Onassis was the wife of the 35th...sband in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, when he was assassinated., has type Politician\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nDate founded (fb:organization.organization.date_founded): part of Organization schema, links to type Date/Time\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat school did Robert F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What movie did Ron Howard do that was produced by Walt Disney?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "4a3c8000758f4effa9b5c6d95e64142f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What movie did Ron Howard do that was produced by Walt Disney?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat movie directed by Ron Howard that was produced by DreamWorks Studios?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0g2lq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0g2lq fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.directed_by fb:m.0g2lq .\n  ?x fb:film.film.production_companies fb:m.01gb54 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDreamWorks Studios, also known as Dreamworks Pictures, DW Studios, LLC., DreamWorks Studios, DreamWorks SKG, Dreamworks, LLC (fb:m.01gb54): DreamWorks Studios also known as DreamWorks SKG, DreamWorks Pict...g DreamWorks SKG into DreamWorks Studios, an independent entity., has type Production company\nRon Howard, also known as Ronny Howard, Ron, Ronnie Howard, Ronald William \"Ron\" Howard, Ronald William Howard (fb:m.0g2lq): Ronald William \"Ron\" Howard is an American film director, produc...m.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Name the city where LaLa Anthony lives now and the fictional character Stringer Bell once lived.?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f76fb284954d419eaa6966fec6550e7e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Name the city where LaLa Anthony lives now and the fictional character Stringer Bell once lived.?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat time zone is the city that was the home of the Fictional person Bad Bill located in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:fictional_universe.fictional_setting.characters_that_have_lived_here fb:m.0g9m4qw .\n  ?c fb:location.location.time_zones ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBad Bill (fb:m.0g9m4qw): Bad Bill is a fictional character in the 2011 animated action/adventure film Rango., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nCharacters that have lived here (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_setting.characters_that_have_lived_here): links to type Fictional Character, part of Fictional Setting schema\nTime zone(s) (fb:location.location.time_zones): links to type Time Zone, part of Location schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat city is home to Carlos Santana and also to the fictional character Chloe King?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01304j ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01304j fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:fictional_universe.fictional_setting.characters_that_have_lived_here fb:m.0gz74f1 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCarlos Santana, also known as Santana, Carlos, Santana, Mr. Carlos Santana, Devadip Carlos Santana, C.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the earliest founded team that Peyton Manning's dad has played for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "45fa6576f6774adf8f733ab4d343286a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the earliest founded team that Peyton Manning's dad has played for?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich of the football teams for which Emmitt Smith played was the most recently founded sports team?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01480y ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01480y fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team ?x .\n  ?x fb:sports.sports_team.founded ?num .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?num )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nEmmitt Smith, also known as Emmitt James Smith III, emmitt_smith (fb:m.01480y): Emmitt James Smith, III is an American former college and profes...same year three times when to that point it had never been done., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nTeams (fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams): links to type Sports team roster, part of Athlete schema\nFounded (fb:sports.sports_team.founded): part of Sports Team schema, links to type Date/Time\nTeam (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Sports Team\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich football team founded earliest did Emmitt Smith play for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01480y ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01480y fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team ?x .\n  ?x fb:sports.sports_team.founded ?num .\n}\nORDER BY ?num\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nEmmitt Smith, also known as Emmitt James Smith III, emmitt_smith (fb:m.01480y): Emmitt James Smith, III is an American former college and profes...same year three times when to that point it had never been done., has type American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nTeams (fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams): links to type Sports team roster, part of Athlete schema\nFounded (fb:sports.sports_team.founded): part of Sports Team schema, links to type Date/Time\nTeam (fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team): part of Sports team roster schema, links to type Sports Team\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat team does Lamar Play for that was founded before 1959?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02_nkp ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02_nkp fb:sports.pro_athlete.teams ?y .\n  ?y fb:sports.sports_team_roster.team ?x .\n  ?x fb:sports.sports_team.founded ?num .\n  FILTER ( ?num < \"1959\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLamar Odom, also known as Lamar Joseph Odom, Lam Lam, Lamy (fb:m.02_nkp): Lamar Joseph Odom is an American professional basketball player ...raded him to Dallas.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which actor who portrayed Vito Corleone also played in Joy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "b2c2f66752634a2d90437feb3a81537c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which actor who portrayed Vito Corleone also played in Joy?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat movie is in Italian and stars Quentin Tarantino?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0693l ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0693l fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.language fb:m.02bjrlw .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItalian Language, also known as Italian, Italiano (fb:m.02bjrlw): Italian is a Romance language spoken mainly in Europe: Italy, Sw...present in large numbers in German- and French-speaking cantons., has type Human Language\nQuentin Tarantino, also known as Tarantino Q, Quentin Tarrantino, Quentin Jerome Tarantino, QT, Q (fb:m.0693l): Quentin Jerome Tarantino is an American film director, screenwri...ased Jackie Brown in 1997, an adaptation of the novel Rum Punch., has type Film director\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nLanguages (fb:film.film.language): links to type Human Language, part of Film schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nIn a Joy Newman movie, who played Howard Stern?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film.starring ?k .\n  ?k fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.0vx6_2d .\n  ?c fb:film.film.starring ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.special_performance_type ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.0sx5w .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHoward Stern, also known as Tzvi, The Howard, Stern, Howard, Stern Howard, King of All Media (fb:m.0sx5w): Howard Allan Stern is an American radio and television personali...2.5 million to station licensees for content it deemed indecent., has type Celebrity\nJoy Newman (fb:m.0vx6_2d): Joy Newman is an actress., has type Film actor\n\nUsing properties:\nPerformances (fb:film.film.starring): links to type Film performance, part of Film schema\nActor (fb:film.performance.actor): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film actor\nSpecial Performance Type (fb:film.performance.special_performance_type): links to type Special film performance type, part of Film performance schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat character did James Franco play in the movie that also featured Carol Ruth Silver?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film.starring ?k .\n  ?k fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.04lgvd9 .\n  ?c fb:film.film.starring ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.05bnp0 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCarol Ruth Silver (fb:m.04lgvd9): Carol Ruth Silver is an American lawyer and activist.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What film featued Fab Five Freddy as a director and had Tupac playing a role in the movie?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "386fb20ea4ad451fb3911afae41b4d40", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What film featued Fab Five Freddy as a director and had Tupac playing a role in the movie?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat film was released before 1995-02-14 and featured Tupac?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07pzc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07pzc fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.release_date_s ?c .\n  ?c fb:film.film_regional_release_date.release_date ?num .\n  FILTER ( ?num < \"1995-02-14\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTupac Shakur, also known as Lesane Parish Crooks, TuPac, Makaveli, Pac, Tupac Amaru Shakur (fb:m.07pzc): Tupac Amaru Shakur, also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makav...e Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nRelease date(s) (fb:film.film.release_date_s): links to type Film regional release date, part of Film schema\nRelease Date (fb:film.film_regional_release_date.release_date): part of Film regional release date schema, links to type Date/Time\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat movie directed by John Singleton did Tupac star in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07pzc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07pzc fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.directed_by fb:m.014gc6 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn Singleton, also known as John Daniel Singleton (fb:m.014gc6): John Daniel Singleton is an American film director, screenwriter...action films such as Shaft, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Four Brothers., has type Film director\nTupac Shakur, also known as Lesane Parish Crooks, TuPac, Makaveli, Pac, Tupac Amaru Shakur (fb:m.07pzc): Tupac Amaru Shakur, also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makav...e Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nDirected by (fb:film.film.directed_by): links to type Film director, part of Film schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhich of the films starring Tupac was released first?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.07pzc ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.07pzc fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.initial_release_date ?num .\n}\nORDER BY ?num\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nTupac Shakur, also known as Lesane Parish Crooks, TuPac, Makaveli, Pac, Tupac Amaru Shakur (fb:m.07pzc): Tupac Amaru Shakur, also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makav...e Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nInitial release date (fb:film.film.initial_release_date): links to type Date/Time, part of Film schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film", "tool_call_id": "386fb20ea4ad451fb3911afae41b4d40"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that Tupac Amaru Shakur is represented by the entity fb:m.07pzc in Freebase.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What has Charlie Hunnam acted in, as well as the movie that Emily Coutts played in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "32377fe2362f44a295e0ff5dded8fa24", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What has Charlie Hunnam acted in, as well as the movie that Emily Coutts played in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat movies did charlie hunnam, and Emily Coutts play in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.057yk8 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.057yk8 fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.starring ?c .\n  ?c fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.0113yh_y .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEmily Coutts (fb:m.0113yh_y): Emily Coutts is an actress., has type Film actor\nCharlie Hunnam, also known as Charles Matthew Hunnam, Charlie Matthew Hunnam, Charlie (fb:m.057yk8): Charles Matthew \"Charlie\" Hunnam is an English actor and screenw...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What film as produced by W.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Where should I visit at 216 O St. in downtown Sacramento?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1c8589c13fbc46a89de1febde369cf0a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Where should I visit at 216 O St. in downtown Sacramento?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhen I visit San Jose, CA, what structure should I visit that opened earliest?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f04v ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f04v fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened ?num .\n}\nORDER BY ?num\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nSan Jose, also known as San Jos\u00e9, San Jose, CA, San Jose, California, Santa Clara County / San Jose city (fb:m.0f04v): San Jose is the third-largest city by population in California, ...expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat structure opened in 1887 should I visit in Denver?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02cl1 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02cl1 fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened \"1887\" ^^ xsd:dateTime .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDenver, also known as Denver, CO, Denver, Colorado, Denver County, Denver County / Denver city (fb:m.02cl1): Denver is the capital and most populous municipality of the U.S....ed as the 21st most populous U.S. metropolitan statistical area., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nOf the best things to do in San Diego, which building opened earliest?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.071vr ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.071vr fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened ?num .\n}\nORDER BY ?num\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nSan Diego, also known as Sunny San Diego, San Diego County / San Diego city, San Diego, California, San Diego, CA (fb:m.071vr): San Diego /\u02ccs\u00e6n di\u02d0\u02c8e\u026a\u0261o\u028a/ is a major city in California, on the... formed the first European settlement in what is now California., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction", "tool_call_id": "1c8589c13fbc46a89de1febde369cf0a"}, {"content": "The examples found are about tourist attractions or structures to visit in a city, but none specifically address visiting a particular address.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What stadium does the sports team owned by Thomas S.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who fought in the Battle of Vicksburg and was the 18th US president?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "970855e81427423e8bf61b07aeb13d20", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Who fought in the Battle of Vicksburg and was the 18th US president?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nIn which state in the United States was the Battle of Vicksburg fought?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01hf7f ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01hf7f fb:time.event.locations ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.administrative_division.country fb:m.09c7w0 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSiege of Vicksburg (fb:m.01hf7f): The Siege of Vicksburg was the final major military action in th..., as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article., has type Military Conflict\nUnited States of America, also known as U.S. of A., USA, U.S.A., US, U.S. (fb:m.09c7w0): The United States of America, commonly referred to as the United...s emerged from 13 British colonies located along the East Coast., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.administrative_division.country): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country\nLocation(s) (fb:time.event.locations): links to type Location, part of Event schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nIn which administrative division in the USA did The Battle of Vicksburg take place?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01hf7f ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01hf7f fb:time.event.locations ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.administrative_division.country fb:m.09c7w0 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSiege of Vicksburg (fb:m.01hf7f): The Siege of Vicksburg was the final major military action in th..., as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article., has type Military Conflict\nUnited States of America, also known as U.S. of A., USA, U.S.A., US, U.S. (fb:m.09c7w0): The United States of America, commonly referred to as the United...s emerged from 13 British colonies located along the East Coast., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nCountry (fb:location.administrative_division.country): part of Administrative Division schema, links to type Country\nLocation(s) (fb:time.event.locations): links to type Location, part of Event schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat state with capital city named Jackson did the Battle of Vicksburg occur?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01hf7f ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01hf7f fb:time.event.locations ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.us_state.capital fb:m.043yj .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSiege of Vicksburg (fb:m.01hf7f): The Siege of Vicksburg was the final major military action in th..., as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article., has type Military Conflict\nJackson, also known as Rankin County / Jackson city, Jackson, Mississippi (fb:m.043yj): Jackson is the capital of and the largest city in the state of M...ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the city., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nCapital (fb:location.us_state.capital): links to type City/Town/Village, part of US State schema\nLocation(s) (fb:time.event.locations): links to type Location, part of Event schema", "tool_call_id": "970855e81427423e8bf61b07aeb13d20"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query information about the Battle of Vicksburg using the entity \"Siege of Vicksburg\" (fb:m.01hf7f).

For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Where did Lauren Conrad live, and is the location that a person with the date of birth on March 2,1954 was born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "6a1b3f74c31444db960e7ff2058a73ee", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Where did Lauren Conrad live, and is the location that a person with the date of birth on March 2,1954 was born?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhere did the artist who went on Secrets Tour born and raised?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:music.artist.concert_tours fb:m.0gvsbwl .\n  ?c fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSecrets Tour (fb:m.0gvsbwl): The Secrets Tour was the debut concert tour by American pop/R&B ...the U.S. were billed as, An Evening with Kenny G & Toni Braxton.\n\nUsing properties:\nConcert Tours (fb:music.artist.concert_tours): part of Musical Artist schema, links to type Concert tour\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat place where someone was born 1985-02-20 is the home of Carlos Santana?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01304j ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01304j fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.location.people_born_here ?c .\n  ?c fb:people.person.date_of_birth \"1985-02-20\" ^^ xsd:dateTime .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCarlos Santana, also known as Santana, Carlos, Santana, Mr. Carlos Santana, Devadip Carlos Santana, C.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the governor of the state where Dave Freudenthal is a District representative?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a9f9d238dbfc423384b1d9419f5e66c2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Who is the governor of the state where Dave Freudenthal is a District representative?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWho's the new governor of the location, that appointed Rick Scott to a governmental position in 2011?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?k .\n  ?k fb:government.government_position_held.appointed_by fb:m.0btx2g .\n  ?c fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?x .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.basic_title fb:m.0fkvn .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2011-12-31\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2011-01-01\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk4\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk5 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk5 ) <= \"2011-12-31\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk6\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk7 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk7 ) >= \"2011-01-01\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk8 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk8 ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nRick Scott, also known as Richard L Scott, Richard Lynn Scott (fb:m.0btx2g): Richard \"Rick\" Lynn Scott is an American businessman and politic...against him personally.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Of all the countries in Oceania, which one has an official symbol of an Illawarra Flame Tree?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "fed07f67f05c4b679161e989413a6fd8", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Of all the countries in Oceania, which one has an official symbol of an Illawarra Flame Tree?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat country has a symbol the coast of arms of the Solomon Islands?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:symbols.coat_of_arms_bearer.coat_of_arms_used ?k .\n  ?k fb:symbols.armorial_grant.coat_of_arms fb:m.0czgbm .\n  ?c fb:government.politician.government_positions_held ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCoat of arms of the Solomon Islands (fb:m.0czgbm): The coat of arms of Solomon Islands shows a shield which is fram...d there is a helmet with decorations, crowned by a stylized sun., has type Coat of Arms\n\nUsing properties:\nJurisdiction of office (fb:government.government_position_held.jurisdiction_of_office): links to type Governmental Jurisdiction, part of Government Position Held schema\nGovernment Positions Held (fb:government.politician.government_positions_held): links to type Government Position Held, part of Politician schema\nCoat of Arms (fb:symbols.armorial_grant.coat_of_arms): part of Armorial Grant schema, links to type Coat of Arms\nCoat of Arms used (fb:symbols.coat_of_arms_bearer.coat_of_arms_used): part of Coat of Arms Bearer schema, links to type Armorial Grant\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat country has the symbol of Floral emblem that James Watt comes from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.043rm ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.043rm fb:people.person.nationality ?x .\n  ?x fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.official_symbols ?c .\n  ?c fb:location.location_symbol_relationship.Kind_of_symbol fb:m.0962ft .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJames Watt (fb:m.043rm): James Watt, FRS, FRSE was a Scottish inventor and mechanical eng...cant as his steam engine work.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What stop motion movie did Ron Howard do a voice in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f0df8b8e9d8b4ed4bdf5d5662d35d691", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What stop motion movie did Ron Howard do a voice in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat stop motion movies did Ron Howard direct?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0g2lq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0g2lq fb:film.director.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.genre ?c .\n  ?c fb:type.object.name \"Stop motion\" @en .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRon Howard, also known as Ronny Howard, Ron, Ronnie Howard, Ronald William \"Ron\" Howard, Ronald William Howard (fb:m.0g2lq): Ronald William \"Ron\" Howard is an American film director, produc...m.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the mascot of the organization with the person named Eric F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What country has a political title called Minister of Women in the Presidency and they speak portuguese?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "becafd90a6c84bbe929b420b625fe66c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What country has a political title called Minister of Women in the Presidency and they speak portuguese?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of government does the country where they speak Brazilian Portuguese have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:location.country.languages_spoken fb:m.02zj58 .\n  ?c fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBrazilian Portuguese (fb:m.02zj58): Brazilian Portuguese is a set of dialects of the Portuguese lang...orm.
