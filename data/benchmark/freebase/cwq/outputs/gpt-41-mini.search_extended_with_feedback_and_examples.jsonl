Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What city near the Grand Canyon was an American football player born in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2a8aaf4ff08f45b89c53bc7511d0f4eb", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What city near the Grand Canyon was an American football player born in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nIn which city does Carlos Santana live that was also the birthplace of an American football player?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01304j ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01304j fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.location.people_born_here ?c .\n  ?c fb:type.object.type fb:american_football.football_player .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAmerican football player (fb:american_football.football_player)\nCarlos Santana, also known as Santana, Carlos, Santana, Mr. Carlos Santana, Devadip Carlos Santana, C.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who played the fictional character, Batgirl, that's the parent of James Gordon, Jr.?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "752c8bc0adbc4bc7b2b5a9434e6c3e76", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Who played the fictional character, Batgirl, that's the parent of James Gordon, Jr.?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nThe fictional character that played the parent of Scout Finch, did what as a profession?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.children fb:m.0j6n38m .\n  ?c fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.occupation ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nScout Finch, also known as Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch (fb:m.0j6n38m): Scout Finch is a fictional character from To Kill a Mockingbird., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nChildren (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.children): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Character\nOccupation (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.occupation): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Character Occupation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich actors played the parents of the Gotham Rogues Player #9 character?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.actor.film ?k .\n  ?k fb:film.performance.character fb:m.0y7gvsj .\n  ?c fb:people.person.parents ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGotham Rogues Player #9 (fb:m.0y7gvsj): Gotham Rogues Player #9 is a fictional character from the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nCharacter (fb:film.performance.character): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film character\nParents (fb:people.person.parents): part of Person schema, links to type Person\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWho plays the character born in Gotham City in 2012?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.place_of_birth fb:m.03fdg .\n  ?c fb:tv.tv_character.appeared_in_tv_program ?y .\n  ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.actor ?x .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2012-12-31\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2012-01-01\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGotham City (fb:m.03fdg): Gotham City or Gotham is a fictional American city appearing in ...pict the less urban setting of Wayne Manor in live action films., has type Fictional Setting\n\nUsing properties:\nPlace of Birth (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.place_of_birth): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Setting\nActor (fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.actor): part of TV Regular Performance schema, links to type TV Actor\nFrom (fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.from): part of TV Regular Performance schema, links to type Date/Time\nTo (fb:tv.regular_tv_appearance.to): part of TV Regular Performance schema, links to type Date/Time\nPrograms in which this was a regular character (fb:tv.tv_character.appeared_in_tv_program): links to type TV Regular Performance, part of TV Character schema", "tool_call_id": "752c8bc0adbc4bc7b2b5a9434e6c3e76"}, {"content": "From the examples, it seems we need to identify the fictional character Batgirl who is the parent of James Gordon, Jr., and then find the actor who played that character.\n\nStep 1: Identify the entity for James Gordon, Jr.\nStep 2: Find the parent of James Gordon, Jr. who is the fictional character Batgirl.\nStep 3: Find the actor who played that fictional character.\n\nI will start by searching for the entity \"James Gordon, Jr.\" in the knowledge graph.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"James Gordon, Jr.\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_dBw4IiHOrby7ZvJhkQ7WtQmG", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the college that was founded before 1821 which Charles Drew attended?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ff25c19055a6470eb69d30235f25a6c7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the college that was founded before 1821 which Charles Drew attended?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat college did Charles Richard Drew go to that has the largest number of undergraduates?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.018t67 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.018t67 fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n  ?x fb:education.university.number_of_undergraduates ?c .\n  ?c fb:measurement_unit.dated_integer.number ?num .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:integer ( ?num ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nCharles R.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What country with the GDP Real Adjusted Value once of 100236410771.0 do people speak Portuguese?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "904e903537434d2eae8721aed24ad5b7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What country with the GDP Real Adjusted Value once of 100236410771.0 do people speak Portuguese?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhere's a place that has a GDP change rate of 0.8, and they speak portuguese?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05zjd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05zjd fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.statistical_region.gdp_deflator_change ?c .\n  ?c fb:measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate \"0.8\" .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPortuguese Language, also known as Portugese, Portugu\u00eas, Portuguese, Portuguese language (fb:m.05zjd): Portuguese is a Romance language and the sole official language ... and is an official language of the European Union and Mercosul., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nSpoken in countries (fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country\nGDP deflator change (fb:location.statistical_region.gdp_deflator_change): part of Statistical region schema, links to type Dated Percentage\nRate (fb:measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate): links to type Floating Point Number, part of Dated Percentage schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the currency of the country where Brazilian Portuguese is spoken at?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:location.country.languages_spoken fb:m.02zj58 .\n  ?c fb:location.country.currency_used ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBrazilian Portuguese (fb:m.02zj58): Brazilian Portuguese is a set of dialects of the Portuguese lang...orm.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which country with a population of 10,005,000 speaks Portuguese?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a9878a942eab4a79813233649bcc8c96", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which country with a population of 10,005,000 speaks Portuguese?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the largest country in the world to have a Portuguese speaking population?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05zjd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05zjd fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n  ?x fb:topic_server.population_number ?num .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:integer ( ?num ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nPortuguese Language, also known as Portugese, Portugu\u00eas, Portuguese, Portuguese language (fb:m.05zjd): Portuguese is a Romance language and the sole official language ... and is an official language of the European Union and Mercosul., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nSpoken in countries (fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat area with a population of 10019610 speaks Portuguese?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05zjd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05zjd fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n  ?x fb:topic_server.population_number \"10019610\" .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPortuguese Language, also known as Portugese, Portugu\u00eas, Portuguese, Portuguese language (fb:m.05zjd): Portuguese is a Romance language and the sole official language ... and is an official language of the European Union and Mercosul., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nSpoken in countries (fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat country with ISO number of 020 speaks Portuguese?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.05zjd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.05zjd fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.country.iso_numeric \"020\" .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPortuguese Language, also known as Portugese, Portugu\u00eas, Portuguese, Portuguese language (fb:m.05zjd): Portuguese is a Romance language and the sole official language ... and is an official language of the European Union and Mercosul., has type Human Language\n\nUsing properties:\nSpoken in countries (fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country\nISO Numeric (fb:location.country.iso_numeric): links to type Enumeration, part of Country schema", "tool_call_id": "a9878a942eab4a79813233649bcc8c96"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that the Portuguese language entity is fb:m.05zjd and the property for countries where a language is spoken is fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Of the movies that Miley Cyrus been in, which film was released on December 25,2003?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ddc23712eb744de78cfc42bb9953c0d4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Of the movies that Miley Cyrus been in, which film was released on December 25,2003?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat movies was Selena Gomez in that were released after July 25, 2003?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0gs6vr ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0gs6vr fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.release_date_s ?c .\n  ?c fb:film.film_regional_release_date.release_date ?num .\n  FILTER ( ?num > \"2003-07-25\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSelena Gomez, also known as Selly, Selenita, Selena Marie Gomez, Sel, Conchita (fb:m.0gs6vr): Selena Marie Gomez is an American actress, singer and fashion de...rds following the completion of her greatest hits album For You., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nRelease date(s) (fb:film.film.release_date_s): links to type Film regional release date, part of Film schema\nRelease Date (fb:film.film_regional_release_date.release_date): part of Film regional release date schema, links to type Date/Time\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat movie did Zac Efron star in that was released in 2003?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06wm0z ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06wm0z fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.release_date_s ?c .\n  ?c fb:film.film_regional_release_date.release_date \"2003\" ^^ xsd:dateTime .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nZac Efron, also known as Zefron, Zacquisha, Zachary Efron, Zachary David Alexander \"Zac\" Efron, Zac (fb:m.06wm0z): Zachary David Alexander \"Zac\" Efron is an American actor and sin...e, The Lucky One, That Awkward Moment, Neighbors, and The Lorax., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nRelease date(s) (fb:film.film.release_date_s): links to type Film regional release date, part of Film schema\nRelease Date (fb:film.film_regional_release_date.release_date): part of Film regional release date schema, links to type Date/Time\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhich movies released in 2003 star Zac Efron?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.06wm0z ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.06wm0z fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.initial_release_date \"2003\" ^^ xsd:dateTime .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nZac Efron, also known as Zefron, Zacquisha, Zachary Efron, Zachary David Alexander \"Zac\" Efron, Zac (fb:m.06wm0z): Zachary David Alexander \"Zac\" Efron is an American actor and sin...e, The Lucky One, That Awkward Moment, Neighbors, and The Lorax., has type Celebrity\n\nUsing properties:\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nInitial release date (fb:film.film.initial_release_date): links to type Date/Time, part of Film schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film", "tool_call_id": "ddc23712eb744de78cfc42bb9953c0d4"}, {"content": "From the examples, the pattern to find movies an actor has been in and filter by release date involves:\n- Finding the actor entity\n- Using the property fb:film.actor.film to get film performances\n- Using fb:film.performance.film to get the films\n- Using fb:film.film.release_date_s or fb:film.film.initial_release_date to filter by release date\n\nNext, I will search for the entity corresponding to \"Miley Cyrus\" in Freebase.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"freebase\",\"query\":\"Miley Cyrus\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_jBTUoWIGZi82RWE1scCyszdu", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which producer of Artifact dated Scarlett Johansson?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "6dcd8c73066b4dcd97591f328bdb5aaa", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which producer of Artifact dated Scarlett Johansson?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat Film Producer did Ben Stiller date?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0mdqp ) FILTER ( !

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which residence of Lauren Conrad was the birthplace of Hikaru Sulu?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "9c3b88799641403ea8cca8769107fed2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which residence of Lauren Conrad was the birthplace of Hikaru Sulu?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthplace of the subject of the film Obama Anak Menteng?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film_subject.films fb:m.0bx_4p9 .\n  ?c fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nObama Anak Menteng, also known as Little Obama (fb:m.0bx_4p9): Obama Anak Menteng is a 2010 biopic drama film written and direc... of the United States, who lived in Indonesia from 1967 to 1971., has type Film\n\nUsing properties:\nFilms On This Subject (fb:film.film_subject.films): part of Film subject schema, links to type Film\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the birthplace of the person that used to live in Marin City?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:people.person.places_lived ?k .\n  ?k fb:people.place_lived.location fb:m.053myr .\n  ?c fb:people.person.place_of_birth ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarin City, also known as Marin City, California (fb:m.053myr): Marin City, is an unincorporated community and census-designated...found celebrity in the 1990s as the home of rapper Tupac Shakur., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nPlace of birth (fb:people.person.place_of_birth): links to type Location, part of Person schema\nPlaces lived (fb:people.person.places_lived): links to type Place lived, part of Person schema\nLocation (fb:people.place_lived.location): part of Place lived schema, links to type Location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat home of Charlton Heston is the location where a Hall of Fame inductee was born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0chsq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0chsq fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.location.people_born_here ?c .\n  ?c fb:type.object.type fb:award.hall_of_fame_induction .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHall of fame induction (fb:award.hall_of_fame_induction)\nCharlton Heston, also known as John Charles Carter, Chuck, Charlton Easton, Charlie, Captured Slave Charlton Heston (fb:m.0chsq): Charlton Heston was an American actor and political activist.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which schools attended by President Kennedy were founded before 1890?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c46d4f05c1eb4deba0c38a8a2633491d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which schools attended by President Kennedy were founded before 1890?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich college founded before 02-09-1821 did Jackie Kennedy go to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0h6mq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0h6mq fb:people.person.education ?y .\n  ?y fb:education.education.institution ?x .\n  ?x fb:common.topic.notable_types fb:m.01y2hnl .\n  ?x fb:organization.organization.date_founded ?num .\n  FILTER ( ?num < \"1821-02-09\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCollege/University, also known as College, University (fb:m.01y2hnl): The College/University type is used for institutions that offer ...mation, please see the Freebase wiki page on College/University.\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also known as Jacqueline Lee Bouvier, Supertanker, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Onassis, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (fb:m.0h6mq): Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Kennedy Onassis was the wife of the 35th...sband in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, when he was assassinated., has type Politician\n\nUsing properties:\nNotable types (fb:common.topic.notable_types): part of Topic schema, links to type Type\nInstitution (fb:education.education.institution): links to type Educational Institution, part of Education schema\nDate founded (fb:organization.organization.date_founded): part of Organization schema, links to type Date/Time\nEducation (fb:people.person.education): links to type Education, part of Person schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat school did Robert F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which language spoken in Chile is a member of the Polynesian language group?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "05bd4c9f878845699191a6c5b536182e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which language spoken in Chile is a member of the Polynesian language group?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich Chilean Language family member is spoken in Argentina?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jgd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jgd fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n  ?x fb:language.language_family.languages fb:m.026xd1k .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nQuechua, Chilean Language (fb:m.026xd1k): has type Human Language\nArgentina, also known as Agrentina , Argentine Republic, The Argentine (fb:m.0jgd): Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal repub...a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nlanguages (fb:language.language_family.languages): part of Language Family schema, links to type Human Language\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat Chilean Language family is spoken in Argentina?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jgd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jgd fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n  ?x fb:language.language_family.languages fb:m.026xd1k .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nQuechua, Chilean Language (fb:m.026xd1k): has type Human Language\nArgentina, also known as Agrentina , Argentine Republic, The Argentine (fb:m.0jgd): Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal repub...a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nlanguages (fb:language.language_family.languages): part of Language Family schema, links to type Human Language\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat languages are spoken in Argentina and are part of the language family, Quechua, Chilean language?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0jgd ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0jgd fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n  ?x fb:language.language_family.languages fb:m.026xd1k .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nQuechua, Chilean Language (fb:m.026xd1k): has type Human Language\nArgentina, also known as Agrentina , Argentine Republic, The Argentine (fb:m.0jgd): Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal repub...a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city., has type Country\n\nUsing properties:\nlanguages (fb:language.language_family.languages): part of Language Family schema, links to type Human Language\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema", "tool_call_id": "05bd4c9f878845699191a6c5b536182e"}, {"content": "From the examples, we see that the property fb:location.country.languages_spoken links a country to languages spoken there.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the official language of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "86224e1ec6574eb7a1c04796f57cb660", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the official language of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat language is spoken in the place where the government is called Government of Ukraine?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.government fb:m.04xhxr .\n  ?c fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGovernment of Ukraine (fb:m.04xhxr): has type Government\n\nUsing properties:\nGovernment (fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.government): part of Governmental Jurisdiction schema, links to type Government\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat are the spoken languages in the country with Sviatoslav Shevchuk as its religious leader?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:religion.religious_leadership_jurisdiction.leader ?k .\n  ?k fb:religion.religious_organization_leadership.leader fb:m.0gjbf2p .\n  ?c fb:location.country.languages_spoken ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSviatoslav Shevchuk (fb:m.0gjbf2p): Sviatoslav Shevchuk is the Patriarch of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church since 25 March 2011., has type Religious Leader\n\nUsing properties:\nLanguages spoken (fb:location.country.languages_spoken): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\nLeader (fb:religion.religious_leadership_jurisdiction.leader): links to type Religious Organization Leadership, part of Religious Jurisdiction schema\nLeader (fb:religion.religious_organization_leadership.leader): part of Religious Organization Leadership schema, links to type Religious Leader\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the official language of the Eastern Catholic Churches?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:religion.religious_leadership_jurisdiction.leader ?k .\n  ?k fb:religion.religious_organization_leadership.organization fb:m.01fgks .\n  ?c fb:location.country.official_language ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEastern Catholic Churches (fb:m.01fgks): The Eastern Catholic Churches are self-governing particular chur...eparchies have been established alongside Latin Church dioceses., has type Religious Organization\n\nUsing properties:\nOfficial Language (fb:location.country.official_language): links to type Human Language, part of Country schema\nLeader (fb:religion.religious_leadership_jurisdiction.leader): links to type Religious Organization Leadership, part of Religious Jurisdiction schema\nOrganization (fb:religion.religious_organization_leadership.organization): part of Religious Organization Leadership schema, links to type Religious Organization", "tool_call_id": "86224e1ec6574eb7a1c04796f57cb660"}, {"content": "The examples suggest that the question is about the official language of a religious organization.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which movies directed by Chris Renaud have featured Taylor Swift?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "be521776313a49d09dc64370aaccda96", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which movies directed by Chris Renaud have featured Taylor Swift?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat movies has the award nominated artist for Chriscolfer star in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:award.award_nominee.award_nominations ?k .\n  ?k fb:award.award_nomination.nominated_for fb:m.0yz0kj5 .\n  ?c fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nchriscolfer (fb:m.0yz0kj5): chriscolfer is a 2011 and 2013 Shorty Awards winning Twitter microblog curated by Chris Colfer., has type Blog\n\nUsing properties:\nNominated work (fb:award.award_nomination.nominated_for): links to type Award-Nominated Work, part of Award Nomination schema\nAward Nominations (fb:award.award_nominee.award_nominations): links to type Award Nomination, part of Award Nominee schema\nFilm performances (fb:film.actor.film): links to type Film performance, part of Film actor schema\nFilm (fb:film.performance.film): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat movies feature both Taylor Momsen and Josh Ryan Evans?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.067qp2 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.067qp2 fb:film.actor.film ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.starring ?c .\n  ?c fb:film.performance.actor fb:m.011w1p .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJosh Ryan Evans, also known as JRE, Joshua Ryan Evans, Josh Evans (fb:m.011w1p): Joshua Ryan \"Josh\" Evans was an American actor who became known ...at prevented his body from growing.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the name of the country with the German Democratic Republic where germanic languages are spoken?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "7d025b73103f4901b7bd2e7b12c8af98", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the name of the country with the German Democratic Republic where germanic languages are spoken?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat German speaking location that has the government called German Democratic Republic?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.04306rv ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.04306rv fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n  ?x fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.government fb:m.0b7hx05 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGerman Language, also known as Hochdeutsch, Tedesco, High German, German, Standard Language, German, Standard (fb:m.04306rv): German is a West Germanic language that derives most of its voca...alects or dialect groups are sometimes referred to as languages., has type Human Language\nGovernment of the German Democratic Republic (fb:m.0b7hx05): has type Government\n\nUsing properties:\nGovernment (fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.government): part of Governmental Jurisdiction schema, links to type Government\nSpoken in countries (fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in): part of Human Language schema, links to type Country\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat nation where German was the official language had as its capital city East Berlin?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.04306rv ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.04306rv fb:language.human_language.countries_spoken_in ?x .\n  ?x fb:location.country.official_language fb:m.04306rv .\n  ?x fb:location.country.capital fb:m.02lcc .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEast Berlin (fb:m.02lcc): East Berlin existed between 1949 and 1990.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What actor played the a kid in the movie with a character named Jenny's Father?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a9426b33b6ab499d80c741ad8345d292", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What actor played the a kid in the movie with a character named Jenny's Father?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat actor was featured as the voice of Pamela Darrow's dad in a movie starring her?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film.other_crew ?k .\n  ?k fb:film.film_crew_gig.crewmember fb:m.0cl7qyj .\n  ?c fb:film.film.starring ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.actor ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character fb:m.09nx23w .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarlin, also known as Marlin the Clownfish (fb:m.09nx23w): This clown fish named Marlin is Nemos father and he has trouble ...use of this he becomes slightly over-protective of his son Nemo., has type Film character\nPamela Darrow (fb:m.0cl7qyj): Pamela Darrow is a visual effects artist., has type Film crewmember\n\nUsing properties:\nOther crew (fb:film.film.other_crew): links to type Film crew gig, part of Film schema\nPerformances (fb:film.film.starring): links to type Film performance, part of Film schema\nCrewmember (fb:film.film_crew_gig.crewmember): links to type Film crewmember, part of Film crew gig schema\nActor (fb:film.performance.actor): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film actor\nCharacter (fb:film.performance.character): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film character\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWho played Scout Finch's parent in the movie?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.children fb:m.0j6n38m .\n  ?c fb:film.film_character.portrayed_in_films ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.actor ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nScout Finch, also known as Jean Louise \"Scout\" Finch (fb:m.0j6n38m): Scout Finch is a fictional character from To Kill a Mockingbird., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nChildren (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_character.children): part of Fictional Character schema, links to type Fictional Character\nPortrayed in films (fb:film.film_character.portrayed_in_films): links to type Film performance, part of Film character schema\nActor (fb:film.performance.actor): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film actor\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWho is the star of the film that has a character named Retreat Kid?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film.starring ?k .\n  ?k fb:film.performance.character fb:m.0vmyg8j .\n  ?c fb:film.film.starring ?y .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.actor ?x .\n  ?y fb:film.performance.character fb:m.0gwwcp6 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSimon Birch (fb:m.0gwwcp6): Simon Birch is a fictional character from the 1998 film Simon Birch., has type Film character\nRetreat Kid (fb:m.0vmyg8j): Retreat Kid is a fictional character from the 1998 film Simon Birch., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nPerformances (fb:film.film.starring): links to type Film performance, part of Film schema\nActor (fb:film.performance.actor): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film actor\nCharacter (fb:film.performance.character): part of Film performance schema, links to type Film character", "tool_call_id": "a9426b33b6ab499d80c741ad8345d292"}, {"content": "The question asks for the actor who played a kid in a movie that has a character named \"Jenny's Father.\" To answer this, we need to:\n\n1.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which man is the leader of the country that uses Libya, Libya, Libya as its national anthem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "de33789d880a49f494ab4a3df991c1bc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Which man is the leader of the country that uses Libya, Libya, Libya as its national anthem?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat form of government is used in the country with national anthem Libya, Libya, Libya?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:location.country.national_anthem ?k .\n  ?k fb:government.national_anthem_of_a_country.anthem fb:m.0gg95zf .\n  ?c fb:location.country.form_of_government ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLibya, Libya, Libya (fb:m.0gg95zf): \"Libya, Libya, Libya\", also known as \"Ya Beladi\", or \"O my count... with the lyrics themselves being written by Al Bashir Al Arebi., has type National Anthem\n\nUsing properties:\nAnthem (fb:government.national_anthem_of_a_country.anthem): part of National anthem of a country schema, links to type National Anthem\nForm of Government (fb:location.country.form_of_government): links to type Form of Government, part of Country schema\nNational anthem (fb:location.country.national_anthem): links to type National anthem of a country, part of Country schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWho is the leader of the country that has national anthem There is a Lovely Country?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:location.country.national_anthem ?k .\n  ?k fb:government.national_anthem_of_a_country.anthem fb:m.0n8r4 .\n  ?c fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?x .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2015-08-10\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2015-08-10\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThere is a Lovely Country, also known as Der er et yndigt land (fb:m.0n8r4): Der er et yndigt land, commonly translated into English as There...r et yndigt land, which is treated as the civil national anthem., has type National Anthem\n\nUsing properties:\nFrom (fb:government.government_position_held.from): part of Government Position Held schema, links to type Date/Time\nOfficeholder (fb:government.government_position_held.office_holder): part of Government Position Held schema, links to type Politician\nTo (fb:government.government_position_held.to): part of Government Position Held schema, links to type Date/Time\nGoverning officials (fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials): part of Governmental Jurisdiction schema, links to type Government Position Held\nAnthem (fb:government.national_anthem_of_a_country.anthem): part of National anthem of a country schema, links to type National Anthem\nNational anthem (fb:location.country.national_anthem): links to type National anthem of a country, part of Country schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWho is the leader of the country that have Humat al-hima as its national anthem?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:location.country.national_anthem ?k .\n  ?k fb:government.national_anthem_of_a_country.anthem fb:m.01nwq8 .\n  ?c fb:government.governmental_jurisdiction.governing_officials ?y .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.office_holder ?x .\n  ?y fb:government.government_position_held.basic_title fb:m.01zdtb .\n  FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk0\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.from ?sk1 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk1 ) <= \"2015-08-10\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  ) FILTER ( NOT EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk2\n  }\n  || EXISTS {\n    ?y fb:government.government_position_held.to ?sk3 .\n    FILTER ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk3 ) >= \"2015-08-10\" ^^ xsd:dateTime )\n  }\n  )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHumat al-Hima (fb:m.01nwq8): \u1e24um\u0101t al-\u1e24im\u00e1 is the national anthem of Tunisia.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In what years did Stan Kasten's organization win the World Series?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "3247051ed8f046a09f7e3383f6bf5f79", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"In what years did Stan Kasten's organization win the World Series?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhen was the most recent time did the team with Stan Kasten as its leader win the championship?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:organization.organization.leadership ?k .\n  ?k fb:organization.leadership.person fb:m.0fpx_7 .\n  ?c fb:sports.sports_team.championships ?x .\n  ?x fb:time.event.end_date ?sk0 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( xsd:datetime ( ?sk0 ) )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nStan Kasten (fb:m.0fpx_7): Stan Kasten is the former President of the Atlanta Braves and Wa...e current president, and part-owner, of the Los Angeles Dodgers., has type Organization leader\n\nUsing properties:\nPerson (fb:organization.leadership.person): part of Organization leadership schema, links to type Organization leader\nLeadership (fb:organization.organization.leadership): links to type Organization leadership, part of Organization schema\nChampionships (fb:sports.sports_team.championships): links to type Sports League Championship Event, part of Sports Team schema\nEnd date (fb:time.event.end_date): links to type Date/Time, part of Event schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nIn what years did the organization who has someone called Larry Baer in leadership win the world series?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:organization.organization.leadership ?k .\n  ?k fb:organization.leadership.person fb:m.0hhv_6h .\n  ?c fb:sports.sports_team.championships ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLarry Baer (fb:m.0hhv_6h): Laurence M.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who were the brothers of the work to whom Leonard Bernstein dedicated his work to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "cccbb68d0a5444489aac7baa9991633e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Who were the brothers of the work to whom Leonard Bernstein dedicated his work to?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich religion received the dedication of Leonard Bernstein's work?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:media_common.dedicatee.dedications ?k .\n  ?k fb:media_common.dedication.dedicated_by fb:m.0bvzp .\n  ?c fb:base.popstra.celebrity.religion ?y .\n  ?y fb:base.popstra.religion_choice.religion ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLeonard Bernstein, also known as Lenny, Louis Bernstein, Leonhard Bernstein, Leon Bernstein, Lenny Amber (fb:m.0bvzp): Leonard Bernstein was an American composer, conductor, author, m...ic, choral works, opera, chamber music and pieces for the piano., has type Composer\n\nUsing properties:\nReligion (fb:base.popstra.celebrity.religion): links to type Religion Choice, part of Celebrity schema\nReligion (fb:base.popstra.religion_choice.religion): part of Religion Choice schema, links to type Religion\nDedications (fb:media_common.dedicatee.dedications): links to type Dedication, part of Dedicatee schema\nDedicated By (fb:media_common.dedication.dedicated_by): part of Dedication schema, links to type Dedicator\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich person who had a work dedicated to him/her by Leonard Bernstein died first?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  fb:m.0fbrl fb:people.family.members ?x .\n  ?x fb:people.deceased_person.date_of_death ?d .\n}\nORDER BY ?d\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nKennedy family (fb:m.0fbrl): The Kennedy family is an American family of Irish descent who ar...ldest son, Joe, Jr., to enter politics and be elected president., has type Family\n\nUsing properties:\nDate of death (fb:people.deceased_person.date_of_death): part of Deceased Person schema, links to type Date/Time\nMembers (fb:people.family.members): links to type Family member, part of Family schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWho was the wife of the person whom Leonard Bernstein dedicate his work to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:media_common.dedicatee.dedications ?k .\n  ?k fb:media_common.dedication.dedicated_by fb:m.0bvzp .\n  ?c fb:people.person.spouse_s ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.spouse ?x .\n  ?y fb:people.marriage.type_of_union fb:m.04ztj .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarriage, also known as Matrimony, Wedlock (fb:m.04ztj): Marriage, also called matrimony or wedlock, is a socially or rit...of concerns for women's rights and because of international law., has type Religious Practice\nLeonard Bernstein, also known as Lenny, Louis Bernstein, Leonhard Bernstein, Leon Bernstein, Lenny Amber (fb:m.0bvzp): Leonard Bernstein was an American composer, conductor, author, m...ic, choral works, opera, chamber music and pieces for the piano., has type Composer\n\nUsing properties:\nDedications (fb:media_common.dedicatee.dedications): links to type Dedication, part of Dedicatee schema\nDedicated By (fb:media_common.dedication.dedicated_by): part of Dedication schema, links to type Dedicator\nSpouse (fb:people.marriage.spouse): part of Marriage schema, links to type Person\nType of union (fb:people.marriage.type_of_union): links to type Marriage/union type, part of Marriage schema\nSpouse (or domestic partner) (fb:people.person.spouse_s): links to type Marriage, part of Person schema", "tool_call_id": "cccbb68d0a5444489aac7baa9991633e"}, {"content": "From the examples, it seems that the property fb:media_common.dedication.dedicated_by links a dedication to the dedicator (Leonard Bernstein in this case), and the dedications are linked to the dedicatee (the person to whom the work is dedicated).

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Name the city where LaLa Anthony lives now and the fictional character Stringer Bell once lived.?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "cf7f462f3cb64c758b87af58807f9811", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Name the city where LaLa Anthony lives now and the fictional character Stringer Bell once lived.?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat time zone is the city that was the home of the Fictional person Bad Bill located in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:fictional_universe.fictional_setting.characters_that_have_lived_here fb:m.0g9m4qw .\n  ?c fb:location.location.time_zones ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBad Bill (fb:m.0g9m4qw): Bad Bill is a fictional character in the 2011 animated action/adventure film Rango., has type Film character\n\nUsing properties:\nCharacters that have lived here (fb:fictional_universe.fictional_setting.characters_that_have_lived_here): links to type Fictional Character, part of Fictional Setting schema\nTime zone(s) (fb:location.location.time_zones): links to type Time Zone, part of Location schema\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat city is home to Carlos Santana and also to the fictional character Chloe King?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.01304j ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.01304j fb:people.person.places_lived ?y .\n  ?y fb:people.place_lived.location ?x .\n  ?x fb:fictional_universe.fictional_setting.characters_that_have_lived_here fb:m.0gz74f1 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCarlos Santana, also known as Santana, Carlos, Santana, Mr. Carlos Santana, Devadip Carlos Santana, C.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who were the governors of Arizona in 2009 that held the position form 1-6-2003?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "33bc67246cc64a089a9ebfed577e37c9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"Who were the governors of Arizona in 2009 that held the position form 1-6-2003?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWho is the governor who had the positions of Colorado Attorney General in 2009?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( !

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What structure in Downtown Sacramento opened in 1986?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a9369c4a8c2f43e2932a6d410134f4e7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What structure in Downtown Sacramento opened in 1986?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat structure opened in 1984 that is a fun thing to do in Denver, Colorado?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.02cl1 ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.02cl1 fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened \"1894\" ^^ xsd:dateTime .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDenver, also known as Denver, CO, Denver, Colorado, Denver County, Denver County / Denver city (fb:m.02cl1): Denver is the capital and most populous municipality of the U.S....ed as the 21st most populous U.S. metropolitan statistical area., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the name of a structure in San Jose, California that opened in 2002?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f04v ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f04v fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened \"2002\" ^^ xsd:dateTime .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSan Jose, also known as San Jos\u00e9, San Jose, CA, San Jose, California, Santa Clara County / San Jose city (fb:m.0f04v): San Jose is the third-largest city by population in California, ...expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhen I visit San Jose, CA, what structure should I visit that opened earliest?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0f04v ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0f04v fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions ?x .\n  ?x fb:architecture.structure.opened ?num .\n}\nORDER BY ?num\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nSan Jose, also known as San Jos\u00e9, San Jose, CA, San Jose, California, Santa Clara County / San Jose city (fb:m.0f04v): San Jose is the third-largest city by population in California, ...expansion during the 1950s and 1960s by annexing more land area., has type City/Town/Village\n\nUsing properties:\nOpened (fb:architecture.structure.opened): part of Structure schema, links to type Date/Time\nTourist attractions (fb:travel.travel_destination.tourist_attractions): part of Travel destination schema, links to type Tourist attraction", "tool_call_id": "a9369c4a8c2f43e2932a6d410134f4e7"}, {"content": "From the examples, it seems we need to identify the entity for Downtown Sacramento and then find structures in that location that opened in 1986.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Your job is to generate a SPARQL query to answer a given user question.\n\nYou have access to the following knowledge graphs:\nfreebase at https://qlever.cs.uni-freiburg.de/api/freebase\n\nYou can use the following SPARQL prefixes implicitly in all functions:\nfb: <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/\nfbkey: <http://rdf.freebase.com/key/\nrdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\nrdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\nowl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#\nxsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#\nfoaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/\nskos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#\ndct: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/\ndc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\nprov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#\nschema: <http://schema.org/\ngeo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngeosparql: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#\ngn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#\nbd: <http://www.bigdata.com/rdf#\nhint: <http://www.bigdata.com/queryHints#\nwikibase: <http://wikiba.se/ontology#\nqb: <http://purl.org/linked-data/cube#\nvoid: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#\n\nYou should follow a step-by-step approach to generate the SPARQL query:\n1. Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What film as produced by W.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What genre of music favored by Claude Debussy appears in the movie Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "247987ed26fc4bb89e372998ba0cba2c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What genre of music favored by Claude Debussy appears in the movie Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat kind of music did the subject of the movie \"Lisztomnia\" compose?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:film.film_subject.films fb:m.0c4ymr .\n  ?c fb:music.artist.genre ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLisztomania (fb:m.0c4ymr): Lisztomania is a 1975 film by Ken Russell, drawn from a biograph... film, Ringo Starr, drummer of The Beatles, appears as the Pope., has type Film\n\nUsing properties:\nFilms On This Subject (fb:film.film_subject.films): part of Film subject schema, links to type Film\nMusical Genres (fb:music.artist.genre): part of Musical Artist schema, links to type Musical genre\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat genre of music was performed by the artist who recorded Doriella Du Fontaine?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != ?c ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) ?c fb:music.featured_artist.recordings fb:m.0sjzjlg .\n  ?c fb:music.artist.genre ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDoriella Du Fontaine, also known as Doriella du Fontaine (single edit) (fb:m.0sjzjlg): has type Musical Recording\n\nUsing properties:\nMusical Genres (fb:music.artist.genre): part of Musical Artist schema, links to type Musical genre\nRecordings (fb:music.featured_artist.recordings): links to type Musical Recording, part of Featured artist schema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nIn the film Aida, what type of music is Tchaikovsy's compostion?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.063tn ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.063tn fb:music.artist.genre ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film_genre.films_in_this_genre fb:m.027195p .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAida (fb:m.027195p): Aida is a 1953 Italian film version of the opera Aida by Giusepp...as screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival., has type Film\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, also known as Pjotr Tshaikovski, P.I.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which story written by P. D.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What stop motion movie did Ron Howard do a voice in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "8dc38264c02a4a2e8301b3e717b1077a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"freebase\",\n  \"question\": \"What stop motion movie did Ron Howard do a voice in?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat stop motion movies did Ron Howard direct?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  FILTER ( ?x != fb:m.0g2lq ) FILTER ( ! isLiteral( ?x ) || lang( ?x ) = '' || langMatches( lang( ?x ) , 'en' ) ) fb:m.0g2lq fb:film.director.film ?x .\n  ?x fb:film.film.genre ?c .\n  ?c fb:type.object.name \"Stop motion\" @en .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRon Howard, also known as Ronny Howard, Ron, Ronnie Howard, Ronald William \"Ron\" Howard, Ronald William Howard (fb:m.0g2lq): Ronald William \"Ron\" Howard is an American film director, produc...m.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What university with 30477 undergraduates did J.R.R.
