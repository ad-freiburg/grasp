Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many years did the second oldest dog in the world live?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the second oldest dog in the world and then find out how long it lived.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many mountains are located in Germany?"}, {"content": "To answer the question \"How many mountains are located in Germany?\", we need to identify the relevant entities and properties in the knowledge graph.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On how many albums does Mariah Carey perform?"}, {"content": "To answer the question \"On how many albums does Mariah Carey perform?\", we need to identify the entity for Mariah Carey and the property that links her to the albums she has performed on.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who lives longer, series black or bellatrix Lestrange?"}, {"content": "To answer the question of who lives longer between Sirius Black and Bellatrix Lestrange, we need to find their respective dates of birth and death.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who wrote the Erlangen program?"}, {"content": "To answer the question \"Who wrote the Erlangen program?\", we need to identify the entity representing the Erlangen program and then find out who authored it.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In which industry does the House of Medici own a business?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the industry in which the House of Medici owns a business, we need to identify the entity for the House of Medici and then find out what kind of businesses it owns, and finally determine the industry of those businesses.\n\nStep 1: Identify the entity for the House of Medici.\nLet's search for the entity \"House of Medici\" in Wikidata.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"House of Medici\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-049718a63981462285d5e6e95876b909", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On which island is the Indonesian capital located?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the island where the Indonesian capital is located, we need to identify the following:\n\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many All-NBA Team awards have Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant received in the same year?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entities for Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and the property for the All-NBA Team award.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the publisher of Smite ?"}, {"content": "To find out who the publisher of the game Smite is, we need to identify the entity for Smite and then look for the property that indicates the publisher of a video game.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who has won more NBA awards, Michael Jordan or Kobe Bean Bryant\uff1f"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entities for Michael Jordan and Kobe Bean Bryant, and then find the properties related to NBA awards or achievements.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "among the other representative work of the author of hunter x hunter, which one is talking about middle school student?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the author of *Hunter x Hunter* and then find out their other works, specifically the one that involves middle school students.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What was the key event related to Salvador Dal\u00ed?"}, {"content": "To identify the key event related to Salvador Dal\u00ed, we need to first find the entity for Salvador Dal\u00ed and then look for significant events associated with him.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In how many countries has IKEA been established?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the number of countries where IKEA has been established, we need to identify the entity for IKEA and the property that indicates the countries where it operates.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did Venice at any point belong to the Austrian Empire?"}, {"content": "To determine if Venice ever belonged to the Austrian Empire, we need to identify the relevant entities for Venice and the Austrian Empire, and then look for historical relationships or events that indicate a period of Austrian rule over Venice.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Entities\nFirst, let's find the IRIs for Venice and the Austrian Empire.\n\n#### Search for Venice\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"Venice\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-3b4cb66056294309b03d13654c694f02", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many wars did the Empire of Japan participate in?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the number of wars the Empire of Japan participated in, we need to identify the entity representing the Empire of Japan and then find the properties that indicate participation in wars.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In which country was Spotify created?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the country where Spotify was created, we need to identify the entity for Spotify and then find the property that indicates its place of creation or origin.\n\nLet's start by searching for the entity \"Spotify\" in the knowledge graph.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"Spotify\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-7d956ec1f6c740e0934126a7be068445", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On how many albums does Madonna perform?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about how many albums Madonna performs on, we need to identify the entity for Madonna and then find the number of albums she has performed on.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many songs were composed by Jay Chou but not released in his own albums?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the following elements:\n1.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "People of what age belong to the Silent Generation ?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about the age range of people belonging to the Silent Generation, we need to identify the birth years associated with this generation.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "which university is established earlier, university of oxford or university of cambridge?"}, {"content": "To answer this question, we need to identify the entities for the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, and then find their establishment dates.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "how many head of the state does iran have?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about how many heads of state Iran has, we need to identify the relevant entities and properties in the knowledge graph.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In how many countries is pysanka practiced?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about how many countries practice pysanka, we need to identify the following:\n\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many countries are located around the euorpean Lake Constance?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about how many countries are located around Lake Constance, we need to identify the following:\n\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "which state inside USA is batman living in?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about which state inside the USA Batman is living in, we need to identify the following:\n\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Were Angela Merkel and Tony Blair born in the same year?"}, {"content": "To determine if Angela Merkel and Tony Blair were born in the same year, we need to find their birth years and compare them.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is TNFAIP1 ?"}, {"content": "To answer the question about what TNFAIP1 is, we need to identify the corresponding entity in Wikidata and then gather relevant information about it.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result.

One possibility is the \"part of\" property (`wdt:P361`), but we need to ensure that we are looking at the correct level of granularity.\n\nLet's list the triples for the entity `wd:Q17738` (Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope) to see how it is linked to the Star Wars franchise.\n\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"subject\": \"wd:Q17738\"}", "name": "list"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-6faf24e4ceea476db6b74f48aaf114a1", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Got 932 rows and 3 columns, showing the first 10 rows below:\n| subject                                        | property                     | object                                                           |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | instance of (wdt:P31)        | film (wd:Q11424)                                                 |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | title (wdt:P1476)            | Star Wars                                                        |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | publication date (wdt:P577)  | 1977-01-01T00:00:00Z                                             |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | Commons category (wdt:P373)  | Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope                               |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | part of (wdt:P361)           | National Film Registry (wd:Q823422)                              |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | described at URL (wdt:P973)  | <http://www.movist.com/movist3d/movie.asp?mid=110>               |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | short name (wdt:P1813)       | \"Siih N\u00e1h\u00e1sdl\u012f\u012f\u02bc\"@nv                                             |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | country of origin (wdt:P495) | United States (wd:Q30)                                           |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | official website (wdt:P856)  | <https://www.starwars.com/films/star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope> |\n| Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (wd:Q17738) | genre (wdt:P136)             | action film (wd:Q188473)                                         |\n| ...                                            | ...                          | ...                                                              |", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-6faf24e4ceea476db6b74f48aaf114a1"}, {"content": "The list of triples for `wd:Q17738` (Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope) shows that it is an instance of a film and has a title.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.
