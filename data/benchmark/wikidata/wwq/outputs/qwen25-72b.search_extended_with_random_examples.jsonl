Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is jay leno from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e8c09ddbeeb040d988fbaecdd3476c7f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere does morrissey live 2010?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q202246 p:P551 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P551 ?x ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMorrissey, also known as Morissey, Steven Patrick Morrissey, Moz (wd:Q202246): singer-songwriter, autobiographer, British singer, composer, singer, poet\n\nUsing properties:\nresidence, also known as living in, place of residence, resided at, resided in, resident in (wd:P551 as p/ps): the place where the person is or has been, resident, location\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere was the battle of verdun ww1?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q130847 wdt:P276 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBattle of Verdun (wd:Q130847): 1916 battle on the Western Front during the First World War\n\nUsing properties:\nlocation, also known as neighbourhood, whereabouts, vilage, venue, town (wd:P276 as wdt): location of the object, structure or event.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what university did obama graduated from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "61f1bc842d11407083cdbcdee0930af5", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhen president lincoln was elected?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q91 p:P39 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P39 wd:Q1467287 ; pq:P580 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident-elect of the United States, also known as President-Elect (wd:Q1467287): winning candidate of the U.S. presidential election in the time before inauguration\nAbraham Lincoln, also known as President Lincoln, Uncle Abe, Honest Abe, Abe Lincoln (wd:Q91): president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, military officer, statesperson, postmaster, politician, farmer, writer, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat books did aristotle wrote?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q47461344 ; wdt:P50 wd:Q868 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nwritten work, also known as creative written work, written delivery (wd:Q47461344): any work expressed in writing, such as inscriptions, manuscripts, documents or maps\nAristotle, also known as the Stagirite (wd:Q868): 4th-century BCE Classical Greek philosopher and polymath, philosopher\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat should you see in london?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q84 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\nLondon, also known as Loniniensi, Trinovantum, the Big Smoke, Lundenwic, Lundenburh (wd:Q84): capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "61f1bc842d11407083cdbcdee0930af5"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to find the entity for Barack Obama and then look for the property that indicates his alma mater or university he graduated from.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what type of art did leonardo da vinci make?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "54a4113e1b48433f8fb6ab4113f97704", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did jennifer hudson go to school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q192410 wdt:P69 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJennifer Hudson, also known as J.Hud, Jennifer Kate Hudson (wd:Q192410): American singer, actress, model and spokesperson, singer-songwriter, spokesperson, voice actor, film actor, musician, artist, actor\n\nUsing properties:\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat was prince charles last name?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q43274 wdt:P1559 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCharles III, also known as HM King Charles III, King Charles, His Royal Highness Charles III of Great Britain, King of England, King Charles III (wd:Q43274): King of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms since 2022, children's writer, helicopter pilot, environmentalist, philanthropist, entrepreneur, polo player, aristocrat, politician, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nname in native language, also known as native name (wd:P1559 as wdt): name of a person in their native language, name\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does david beckham play for in 2012?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q10520 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDavid Beckham, also known as Becks, Beckham (wd:Q10520): English association football player, association football player, sports executive, businessperson, entrepreneur, blogger, actor, model\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as p/ps): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time", "tool_call_id": "54a4113e1b48433f8fb6ab4113f97704"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the entity for Leonardo da Vinci and the relevant property for the type of art he created.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the religions practiced in indonesia?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "3a3666b69232429dbaa323446b251f6a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do jewish speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q7325 wdt:P103 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJewish people, also known as The Jews, Jewish, The Jewish people, Jews, Jewry (wd:Q7325): ethnoreligious group and nation from the Levant\n\nUsing properties:\nnative language, also known as first language, L1 speaker of, language native, mother tongue (wd:P103 as wdt): language or languages a person has learned from early childhood, languages spoken, written or signed\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho is the current president of the dominican republic?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q786 wdt:P6 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDominican Republic, also known as \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf4, DO, Dominicana, DomRep, DR (wd:Q786): island sovereign state in the Caribbean Sea\n\nUsing properties:\nhead of government, also known as head of national government, mayor, premier, president, prime minister (wd:P6 as wdt): head of the executive power of this town, city, municipality, state, country, or other governmental body, director / manager, chairperson\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is san miguel mexico on map?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q753891 wdt:P625 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSan Miguel de Allende, also known as San Miguel (wd:Q753891): city in Guanajuato, Mexico\n\nUsing properties:\ncoordinate location, also known as point on a map, gps coordinates, gps location, latitude, location (wd:P625 as wdt): geocoordinates of the subject.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who are the virginia senators 2013?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ff042f6db4c54a238271d55bea65b5a6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere was the gettysburg war located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q33132 wdt:P276 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBattle of Gettysburg (wd:Q33132): 1863 battle of the American Civil War\n\nUsing properties:\nlocation, also known as neighbourhood, whereabouts, vilage, venue, town (wd:P276 as wdt): location of the object, structure or event.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are all the songs justin bieber wrote?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f01e5eb5daf7498b9cdd5dfac1d6f2ff", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did john quincy adams died of?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q11816 wdt:P509 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn Quincy Adams, also known as President Adams, JQA, J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did emperor hirohito live?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "837f5aa2833f44f9a0e65313a00ebc3d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho will michael schumacher drive for in 2013?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9671 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Schumacher, also known as Schuey, Schumi (wd:Q9671): German racing driver, Formula One driver, motorcycle racer\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as p/ps): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat character does ellen play in finding nemo?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q132863 p:P725 ?p .\n  ?p pq:P453 ?x .\n  ?p ps:P725 wd:Q483325 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFinding Nemo, also known as Nemo (wd:Q132863): 2003 American animated film\nEllen DeGeneres, also known as Ellen Lee DeGeneres (wd:Q483325): American comedian, television host, actress, and writer (born 1958), LGBTQ rights activist, television presenter, television producer, television actor, talk show host, screenwriter, voice actor, film actor, presenter, comedian, writer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\nvoice actor, also known as voice actors, voice dubber, voice actress, voice actresses, voiced by (wd:P725 as p/ps): performer of a spoken role in a creative work such as animation,...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the main language spoken in mexico?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2a1486fb6ba445f9886630a9a11b95d3", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat are the 5 countries in the united kingdom?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q145 wdt:P150 ?x .\n}\nLIMIT 5\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited Kingdom, also known as U.K., UK, U.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are some of leonardo da vinci most famous inventions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "b624fc0d12004cd3b797f5c005dbc7cb", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho plays lois lane in superman returns?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q328695 p:P161 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q845922 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSuperman Returns (wd:Q328695): 2006 film directed by Bryan Singer\nLois Lane (wd:Q845922): fictional character in DC comics, journalist, reporter\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere was the battle of vicksburg located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1066253 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSiege of Vicksburg, also known as Battle of Vicksburg, Fall of Vicksburg (wd:Q1066253): 1863 battle of the American Civil War's Anaconda Plan\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat can you do in palm springs ca?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q488004 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPalm Springs, also known as Palm City, Palm Springs, CA, Palm Springs, California (wd:Q488004): resort city in Riverside County, southern California, United States\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "b624fc0d12004cd3b797f5c005dbc7cb"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify Leonardo da Vinci and his inventions.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are staffordshire terriers?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "8744c7c4519a43118751f4253ea723ef", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did al capone go to jail?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q80048 wdt:P2632 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of detention, also known as internment at, internment place, jail, jailed at, penal (wd:P2632 as wdt): place where this person is or was detained, residence\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nin what years did the new york yankees win the world series?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?y wdt:P3450 wd:Q265538 ; wdt:P1346 wd:Q213417 ; wdt:P585 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNew York Yankees, also known as New York Highlanders, Yankees, NY Yankees, NYY, Highlanders (wd:Q213417): baseball team and Major League Baseball franchise in the Bronx, New York, United States\nWorld Series, also known as Fall Classic (wd:Q265538): Championship of Major League Baseball\n\nUsing properties:\nwinner, also known as nominee, prizewinner, titleholder, top dog, victor (wd:P1346 as wdt): winner of a competition or similar event, not to be used for awa...ssibly qualified with \"for work\" (P1686)) or for wars or battles, participating team, participant\nsports season of league or competition, also known as sport season, seasons of, edition of annual athletics meeting, season of sports tournament, season of sports league (wd:P3450 as wdt): property that shows the competition of which the item is a season.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was bonnie prince charlie full name?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f1714b46ab7c4f0ea252e7abb4b8aa2c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is a famous person from massachusetts?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P19 wd:Q771 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMassachusetts, also known as Mass., US-MA, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 6th State, The Bay State (wd:Q771): state of the United States of America\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere was toni braxton born and raised?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q155412 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nToni Braxton, also known as Toni Michelle Braxton, Toni Michele Braxton (wd:Q155412): singer-songwriter, recording artist, American singer, record producer, songwriter, film actor, composer, pianist, singer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the primary language of israel?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q801 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIsrael, also known as Yisrael, State of Israel, IL, ISR, il (wd:Q801): country in Western Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used", "tool_call_id": "f1714b46ab7c4f0ea252e7abb4b8aa2c"}, {"content": "Based on these examples, we can see that to find someone's full name, we might need to look for their given name and family name.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was john tyler?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "4a93c9d09fee4a038a02681961fbfd36", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho played mickey on days of our lives?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q185059 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q2094650 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDays of Our Lives, also known as Days of our Lives, DOOL, Days (wd:Q185059): American daytime soap opera\nMickey Horton (wd:Q2094650): Fictional Character of Days of Our Lives\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat do singapore speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q334 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSingapore, also known as SIN, S'pore, Singapore City, SGP, SG (wd:Q334): sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat did florence sabin do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q449487 wdt:P106 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFlorence R.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what to see in phoenix arizona?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "7856a4b659b147cfb5388ead936a3342", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat university did bill clinton graduated from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1124 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBill Clinton, also known as William Jefferson Blythe, William Jefferson Blythe III, William Jefferson \"Bill\" Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton, WJC (wd:Q1124): President of the United States from 1993 to 2001, autobiographer, statesperson, saxophonist, politician, governor, diplomat, teacher, jurist, lawyer, writer\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat religions are in russia?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q159 wdt:P3075 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRussia, also known as Russian Federation, RUS, RU, RF, ISO 3166-1:RU (wd:Q159): country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial religion, also known as established religion, state religion (wd:P3075 as wdt): official religion in this administrative entity\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does leia think her father is?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q51797 wdt:P22 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPrincess Leia, also known as Princess Leia Organa, Leia Organa Solo, Leia Organa, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, General Organa (wd:Q51797): fictional character from Star Wars, starship pilot, politician, diplomat, impostor, rebel, Jedi, spy\n\nUsing properties:\nfather, also known as son of, child of, parent, is son of, is daughter of (wd:P22 as wdt): male parent of the subject.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is kevin jonas married to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f257c5e4fb4d43c39c3699c38840e953", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhich province is calgary canada in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q36312 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCalgary, also known as Calgary, AB, Calgary, Alberta, Calgary, Canada, City of Calgary (wd:Q36312): largest city in Alberta, Canada\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen was reagan inaugurated?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9960 p:P39 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nRonald Reagan, also known as Ronald W Reagan, Ronald W.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was the cause of death for bruce lee?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d4afe69b649444c6b8ea7e203529c066", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho did hera marry?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q38012 wdt:P26 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHera (wd:Q38012): Greek goddess, wife and sister of Zeus\n\nUsing properties:\nspouse, also known as married partner, married to, marry, partner, spouses (wd:P26 as wdt): the subject has the object as their spouse (husband, wife, partn...etc.).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is thor heyerdahl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e3ef029f3f2a46cebc794b8bbb043662", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country did the zulu live in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q10179 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nZulu, also known as isiZulu, Zulu language, zu, zul (wd:Q10179): Nguni language of eastern South Africa and neighbouring countries\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did jane goodall go to school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q184746 wdt:P69 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJane Goodall, also known as Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall, Dame Jane Morris Goodall, Dame Jane Goodall (wd:Q184746): English primatologist and anthropologist (born 1934), ethologist, activist\n\nUsing properties:\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is canadian county oklahoma?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q486614 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCanadian County, also known as Canadian County, OK, Canadian County, Oklahoma (wd:Q486614): county in Oklahoma, United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of", "tool_call_id": "e3ef029f3f2a46cebc794b8bbb043662"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we can see that to answer a question about a person, we first need to identify the entity corresponding to that person in the knowledge graph.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the important holidays of islam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "05ccf237a7bc4185b0e052042d5ae8ef", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is jackie kennedy famous for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q165421 wdt:P800 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also known as Jacqueline Bouvier Onassis, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (wd:Q165421): First Lady of the United States from 1961 to 1963, literary editor, journalist, socialite, writer, model\n\nUsing properties:\nnotable work, also known as artwork, wrote, writer of, works, work (wd:P800 as wdt): notable scientific, artistic or literary work, or other work of significance among subject's works\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did ayrton senna drive for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q10490 wdt:P54 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAyrton Senna, also known as Senna, Ayrton Senna da Silva (wd:Q10490): Brazilian racing driver (1960-1994), racing automobile driver, Formula One driver, businessperson, philanthropist\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as wdt): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat books did jules verne wright?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q47461344 ; wdt:P50 wd:Q33977 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJules Verne, also known as Jules Gabriel Verne, Julius Verne (wd:Q33977): French writer (1828\u20131905), science fiction writer, children's writer, Esperantist, playwright, novelist, writer, poet\nwritten work, also known as creative written work, written delivery (wd:Q47461344): any work expressed in writing, such as inscriptions, manuscripts, documents or maps\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator", "tool_call_id": "05ccf237a7bc4185b0e052042d5ae8ef"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we can see that to find the important holidays of Islam, we need to identify the entity for Islam and then look for properties that might relate to holidays or festivals.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query.

For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who owns volkswagen car company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "70cb4e3f27db434baa19124f0a6143f3", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat county is plainfield il in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1012017 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPlainfield, also known as Plainfield, IL, Plainfield, Illinois (wd:Q1012017): village in Illinois, United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat was the cause of death of michael jackson?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q2831 wdt:P509 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Jackson, also known as M.J., MJ, M.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the title of george bush's new book?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "00883d2e40e543b28423d4af03de49f9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat killed sammy davis jr?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q297816 wdt:P509 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSammy Davis Jr., also known as Samuel George Davis Jr., Sammy Davis Jr (wd:Q297816): American entertainer (1925\u20131990), vaudeville performer, television presenter, television actor, recording artist, autobiographer, jazz musician, entertainer, stage actor, film actor, singer, dancer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncause of death, also known as death cause, murder method, method of murder, die of, die from (wd:P509 as wdt): underlying or immediate cause of death.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where was rihanna raised?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d555dcf6fe774e4db413151a700bdbe1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is christina aguilera from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q41594 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChristina Aguilera, also known as X tina, Xtina, X-tina, Christine Aguilera, Christina Mar\u00eda Aguilera (wd:Q41594): American singer, songwriter and actress, music video director, singer-songwriter, recording artist, record producer, film director, film producer, entrepreneur, voice actor, musician, composer, dancer, model, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen did the red sox win the pennant?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?y wdt:P3450 wd:Q265538 ; p:P1923 ?z ; wdt:P585 ?x .\n  ?z ps:P1923 wd:Q213959 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBoston Red Sox, also known as Sox, redsoxs, RedSox, Red Sox, redsox (wd:Q213959): baseball team and Major League Baseball franchise in Boston, Massachusetts, United States\nWorld Series, also known as Fall Classic (wd:Q265538): Championship of Major League Baseball\n\nUsing properties:\nparticipating team, also known as teams (wd:P1923 as p/ps): like 'Participant' (P710) but for teams.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where do ireland play rugby union?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "6637440db4b54aecabfe1e7b209c7a77", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is located in the balkan peninsula?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q23522 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBalkans, also known as The Balkans, South Balkan area, Peninsula of Haemus, Balkanoid, Haemus Peninsula (wd:Q23522): geopolitical and cultural region of Southeast Europe\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho is the leader of japan?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q17 wdt:P6 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJapan, also known as State of Japan, Nippon-koku, Nippon, Nihon-koku, Nihon (wd:Q17): island country in East Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nhead of government, also known as head of national government, mayor, premier, president, prime minister (wd:P6 as wdt): head of the executive power of this town, city, municipality, state, country, or other governmental body, director / manager, chairperson\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat was tupac name in juice?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q642419 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 wd:Q6107 ; pq:P453 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTupac Shakur, also known as Tupac, Tupac Amaru Shakur, Makaveli, Tupac Omar Shakur, Lesane Crooks (wd:Q6107): American rapper (1971\u20131996), television actor, songwriter, film actor, lyricist, activist, writer, singer, rapper, actor, poet\nJuice (wd:Q642419): 1992 film directed by Ernest Dickerson\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)", "tool_call_id": "6637440db4b54aecabfe1e7b209c7a77"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the entity representing Ireland and the property that indicates where they play rugby union.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who wrote the gospel according to john?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "29afcc64e1584807a80c68a70bcb051e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho does josh hutcherson play in the hunger games?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q212965 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 wd:Q217004 ; pq:P453 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Hunger Games, also known as Hunger Games (wd:Q212965): 2012 film by Gary Ross\nJosh Hutcherson, also known as Joshua Ryan Hutcherson (wd:Q217004): television actor, American actor, voice actor, film actor, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho does david carr play for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q669059 wdt:P54 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDavid Carr, also known as David Duke Carr (wd:Q669059): American football player, quarterback, American football player\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as wdt): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat continent is south africa part of?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q258 wdt:P30 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSouth Africa, also known as zaf, R.S.A., za, RSA, SA (wd:Q258): country in southern Africa\n\nUsing properties:\ncontinent (wd:P30 as wdt): continent of which the subject is a part, located in/on physical feature", "tool_call_id": "29afcc64e1584807a80c68a70bcb051e"}, {"content": "From the examples, we can see that the structure of the SPARQL query typically involves identifying the main entity (in this case, \"Gospel According to John\") and then finding the relevant property (such as \"author\" or \"written by\").

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what year did the baltimore ravens win superbowl?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "63aa31bfcc2a43969c5343ef4e1a3779", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did jack johnson go to high school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q297097 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q9826 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJack Johnson, also known as Jack Hody Johnson (wd:Q297097): American singer-songwriter, singer-songwriter, recording artist, record producer, film director, manufacturer, guitarist, composer, singer, surfer\nhigh school, also known as H.S., upper middle school, senior high school, HS (wd:Q9826): institution which provides all or part of secondary education\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat team did joe hart play for before man city?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q187184 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P582 ?y .\n  wd:Q10520 p:P54 ?q .\n  ?q ps:P54 wd:Q50602 ; pq:P580 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ?y < ?z )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDavid Beckham, also known as Becks, Beckham (wd:Q10520): English association football player, association football player, sports executive, businessperson, entrepreneur, blogger, actor, model\nJoe Hart, also known as Charles Joseph John Hart (wd:Q187184): English association football player, association football player, cricketer\nManchester City F.C., also known as The Sky Blues, City, The Citizens, The Blues, Sky Blues (wd:Q50602): association football club in Manchester, England\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as p/ps): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere tupac grew up?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q6107 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTupac Shakur, also known as Tupac, Tupac Amaru Shakur, Makaveli, Tupac Omar Shakur, Lesane Crooks (wd:Q6107): American rapper (1971\u20131996), television actor, songwriter, film actor, lyricist, activist, writer, singer, rapper, actor, poet\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location", "tool_call_id": "63aa31bfcc2a43969c5343ef4e1a3779"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the Baltimore Ravens and the Super Bowl, and then find the year they won it.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of airport in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1f07535f37154e4d831df84452aa4b85", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat books has elie wiesel written?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q47461344 ; wdt:P50 wd:Q18391 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nElie Wiesel, also known as \u00c9lie Wiesel, Eliezer Wiesel, A-7713 (wd:Q18391): Romanian-born American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel laureate, and Holocaust survivor (1928-2016), association football player, political activist, university teacher, Judaic scholar, autobiographer, philosopher, translator, journalist, playwright, architect, novelist, humanist, writer\nwritten work, also known as creative written work, written delivery (wd:Q47461344): any work expressed in writing, such as inscriptions, manuscripts, documents or maps\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was joseph pulitzer and what did he do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q173417 wdt:P106 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJoseph Pulitzer, also known as j. pulitzer, Pulitzer Jozsef, Joseph \"Joe\" Pulitzer, Pulitzer J\u00f3zsef, Josef Pollitzer (wd:Q173417): Hungarian-American newspaper publisher and politician (1847-1911), newspaper proprietor, politician, journalist, publisher, writer\n\nUsing properties:\noccupation, also known as job, work, vocation, profession, employment (wd:P106 as wdt): occupation of a person; see also \"field of work\" (Property:P101), \"position held\" (Property:P39)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nduring what war did abraham lincoln serve as president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q91 p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q198 ; wdt:P580 ?w ; wdt:P582 ?v .\n  FILTER ( ( ( ?w < ?z ) && ( ?w >= ?y ) ) || ( ( ?v < ?z ) && ( ?v >= ?y ) ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nwar, also known as hostilities, military conflict, wars (wd:Q198): organized and prolonged violent conflict between states\nAbraham Lincoln, also known as President Lincoln, Uncle Abe, Honest Abe, Abe Lincoln (wd:Q91): president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, military officer, statesperson, postmaster, politician, farmer, writer, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as wdt/pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as wdt/pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time", "tool_call_id": "1f07535f37154e4d831df84452aa4b85"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the entity for New York and the property for airport.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what school did karl benz go to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f44801cbcb094b7bbdb03af7af7ad34c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat year did michael jordan started his career?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2031 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Jordan, also known as His Airness, Air Jordan (wd:Q41421): American basketball player and businessman (born 1963), basketball player, baseball player, autobiographer, spokesperson, entrepreneur\n\nUsing properties:\nwork period (start), also known as start working, flourished (start), start time for work, start date of activity, fl.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did margaret hoover go to college?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "65aebd84a23d4982b7cf77170d1a5e52", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did bob dylan live?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q392 wdt:P551 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBob Dylan, also known as Robert Milkwood Thomas, Robert Dylan n\u00e9 Robert Allen Zimmerman, Robert Zimmerman, Robert Dylan, Robert Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman) (wd:Q392): American singer-songwriter (born 1941), radio personality, record producer, autobiographer, film director, screenwriter, disc jockey, film actor, songwriter, guitarist, lyricist, designer, musician, composer, painter, writer, singer, actor, poet\n\nUsing properties:\nresidence, also known as living in, place of residence, resided at, resided in, resident in (wd:P551 as wdt): the place where the person is or has been, resident, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do people speak in iceland?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q189 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIceland, also known as Republic of Iceland, ISL (wd:Q189): Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere did pauley perrette go to college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q231815 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPauley Perrette (wd:Q231815): American actress and musician, television actor, film producer, film director, voice actor, film actor, blogger, writer, actor, poet\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation", "tool_call_id": "65aebd84a23d4982b7cf77170d1a5e52"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the entity for Margaret Hoover and the property for 'educated at'.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is the prime minister of spain 2011?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "eae20a62140e4488b832351380070e70", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho was theodore roosevelt's vice president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q11699 ; pq:P580 ?y .\n  wd:Q33866 p:P39 ?q .\n  ?q ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ?y = ?z )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nVice President of the United States, also known as President of the Senate, President of the United States Senate, United States Vice President, United States VP, USA VP (wd:Q11699): second-highest constitutional office in the United States\nTheodore Roosevelt, also known as Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Teddy Roosevelt (wd:Q33866): 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909, husbandry worker, conservationist, autobiographer, ornithologist, statesperson, naturalist, politician, historian, explorer, essayist, diarist, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of legal system does italy have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q38 wdt:P122 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItaly, also known as Italia, Republic of Italy, Repubblica Italiana, Italian Republic, ITA (wd:Q38): country in Southern Europe\n\nUsing properties:\nbasic form of government, also known as form of government, government, type of government (wd:P122 as wdt): subject's government\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do people speak in iran?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q794 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIran, also known as ir, IRI, IRN, Islamic Rep.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what language do most people speak in afghanistan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "235822e9660f483da4783b7b98976bba", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat songs does katherine jenkins sing?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P175 wd:Q272581 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKatherine Jenkins, also known as Katherine Maria Jenkins, Catherine Maria Jenkins (wd:Q272581): Welsh classical crossover singer, opera singer, music artist\n\nUsing properties:\nperformer, also known as actor, sung by, singer, recording by, recorded by (wd:P175 as wdt): actor, musician, band or other performer associated with this role or musical work, contributor to the creative work or subject\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did robbie hummel go to high school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1571580 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q9826 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRobbie Hummel, also known as Robert John Hummel (wd:Q1571580): American basketball player, basketball player\nhigh school, also known as H.S., upper middle school, senior high school, HS (wd:Q9826): institution which provides all or part of secondary education\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat religions are in russia?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q159 wdt:P3075 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRussia, also known as Russian Federation, RUS, RU, RF, ISO 3166-1:RU (wd:Q159): country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial religion, also known as established religion, state religion (wd:P3075 as wdt): official religion in this administrative entity", "tool_call_id": "235822e9660f483da4783b7b98976bba"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the relevant entity (Afghanistan) and property (language spoken).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when did the san francisco earthquake occur?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "32ee290181e84444b75d16163d35d8a8", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho was phil harris married to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q596717 wdt:P26 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPhil Harris, also known as Wonga Philip Harris (wd:Q596717): American musician (1904\u20131995), television actor, jazz musician, voice actor, songwriter, bandleader, dub actor, conductor, composer, comedian, singer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nspouse, also known as married partner, married to, marry, partner, spouses (wd:P26 as wdt): the subject has the object as their spouse (husband, wife, partn...etc.).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where does robert irvine come from?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "51835f36d88848f286e47f383801de63", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhen was the last time the dallas cowboys went to the super bowl?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?y wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q32096 ; wdt:P1923 wd:Q204862 ; wdt:P585 ?x .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?x )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nDallas Cowboys, also known as Cowboys (wd:Q204862): American football team\nSuper Bowl, also known as AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game (wd:Q32096): National Football League championship game\n\nUsing properties:\nparticipating team, also known as teams (wd:P1923 as wdt): like 'Participant' (P710) but for teams.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did the cleveland cavaliers draft?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ca3b8e97bc544f4f9c7652ef7f760cad", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did giovanni da verrazano live?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q147676 wdt:P551 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGiovanni da Verrazzano (wd:Q147676): Florentine explorer of North America for France, explorer\n\nUsing properties:\nresidence, also known as living in, place of residence, resided at, resided in, resident in (wd:P551 as wdt): the place where the person is or has been, resident, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did president kennedy marry?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9696 wdt:P26 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn F.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what city does fulham play in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d77d39ece76f489188d6ad1421553b8b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the leader of the dominican republic 2011?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q607982 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the Dominican Republic (wd:Q607982): Dominican head of state and head of government\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat year did george washington become the president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q23 p:P39 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nGeorge Washington, also known as Father of the United States (wd:Q23): Founding Father and first U.S. president (1789\u20131797), revolutionary, statesperson, army officer, cartographer, politician, engineer, geometer, writer, farmer\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do haitian speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q790 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHaiti, also known as Ayiti, HAI, Haitian Republic, Hayti, ht (wd:Q790): country in the Caribbean Sea\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used", "tool_call_id": "d77d39ece76f489188d6ad1421553b8b"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to find the entity for Fulham and then look for a property that indicates the city where they play.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who played kirk?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "4e34a18cbe6d4366a30d4a709166e7a2", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did charles drew go to high school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1065848 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q9826 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCharles Drew, also known as Charles Drew, Charles R.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the major languages spoken in the united kingdom?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a2b0ea0836224c59af600f5bf6d26023", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere is the original mona lisa?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q12418 wdt:P276 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, La Joconde, Monna Lisa, The Mona Lisa (wd:Q12418): oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci, Louvre\n\nUsing properties:\nlocation, also known as neighbourhood, whereabouts, vilage, venue, town (wd:P276 as wdt): location of the object, structure or event.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is money called in italy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c7f5f9cde2b04688851810365b5e4fc6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is the mekong river located in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q41179 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMekong River, also known as Lancang Jiang, Mekong R., M\u00e9kong, Mekhong R., Mekhong (wd:Q41179): major river in Southeast Asia\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen did kings last win stanley cup?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?y wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q211872 ; wdt:P1346 wd:Q203008 ; wdt:P585 ?x .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?x )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nLos Angeles Kings, also known as LA Kings (wd:Q203008): hockey team of the National Hockey League\nStanley Cup, also known as Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, Lord Stanley's Cup, Lord Stanley's Mug (wd:Q211872): championship trophy awarded annually in the National Hockey League\n\nUsing properties:\nwinner, also known as nominee, prizewinner, titleholder, top dog, victor (wd:P1346 as wdt): winner of a competition or similar event, not to be used for awa...ssibly qualified with \"for work\" (P1686)) or for wars or battles, participating team, participant\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\npoint in time, also known as at time, as of, year, when, time of event (wd:P585 as wdt): date something took place, existed or a statement was true; for providing time use the \"refine date\" property (P4241)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere was brad pitt born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q35332 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBrad Pitt, also known as William Bradley Pitt, Brad Jolie-Pitt (wd:Q35332): American actor and filmmaker (born 1963), television producer, executive producer, television actor, film producer, film director, voice actor, film actor, producer, director, model, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location", "tool_call_id": "c7f5f9cde2b04688851810365b5e4fc6"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the currency of Italy.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was the name of benjamin franklin wife?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "63eac960e01f4c7f80a26572b93968e6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did matthias schleiden go to school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q76747 wdt:P69 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMatthias Jacob Schleiden, also known as Schleiden, Schleid., Matthias Jakob Schleiden (wd:Q76747): German botanist and philosopher (1804-1881), university teacher, physiologist, philosopher, biologist, botanist\n\nUsing properties:\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nhow many teams are there in the ncaa football?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ( COUNT( * ) AS ?x ) WHERE {\n  ?p wdt:P361 + wd:Q271805 ; wdt:P527 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, also known as NCAA (wd:Q271805): American collegiate athletic organization\n\nUsing properties:\npart of, also known as of, within, system of, subsystem of, subgroup of (wd:P361 as wdt): object of which the subject is a part (if this subject is alread... of \"has part\" (P527, see also \"has parts of the class\" (P2670))\nhas part(s), also known as has component, incorporates, has ingredient, has ingredients, has member (wd:P527 as wdt): part of this subject; inverse property of \"part of\" (P361).
