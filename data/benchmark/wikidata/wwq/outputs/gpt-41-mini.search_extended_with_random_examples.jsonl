Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what has shannen doherty played in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "8f9bb20191d140a1834593b7585b0f7f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat time zone is birmingham england?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q2256 wdt:P421 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBirmingham, also known as Birmingham, England, Birmingham, West Midlands, Birmingham, UK (wd:Q2256): city in West Midlands, England\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in time zone, also known as TZ, time zone, timezone (wd:P421 as wdt): time zone for this item\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen did miami dolphins win super bowl?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?y wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q32096 ; wdt:P1346 wd:Q223243 ; wdt:P585 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMiami Dolphins, also known as Dolphins, Miami (wd:Q223243): National Football League franchise in Miami, Florida\nSuper Bowl, also known as AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game (wd:Q32096): National Football League championship game\n\nUsing properties:\nwinner, also known as nominee, prizewinner, titleholder, top dog, victor (wd:P1346 as wdt): winner of a competition or similar event, not to be used for awa...ssibly qualified with \"for work\" (P1686)) or for wars or battles, participating team, participant\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\npoint in time, also known as at time, as of, year, when, time of event (wd:P585 as wdt): date something took place, existed or a statement was true; for providing time use the \"refine date\" property (P4241)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat did george eastman make?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P61 wd:Q189147 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGeorge Eastman, also known as geog. eastman, g. eastman, Geo.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what type of political system is brazil?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "23de435399ef4d268cfbe1a5e2c56ce6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did president eisenhower go to college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9916 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\nDwight D.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the important holidays of islam?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "523e779920f642b4946b180dc897f49b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is jackie kennedy famous for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q165421 wdt:P800 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis, also known as Jacqueline Bouvier Onassis, Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy-Onassis, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (wd:Q165421): First Lady of the United States from 1961 to 1963, literary editor, journalist, socialite, writer, model\n\nUsing properties:\nnotable work, also known as artwork, wrote, writer of, works, work (wd:P800 as wdt): notable scientific, artistic or literary work, or other work of significance among subject's works\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did ayrton senna drive for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q10490 wdt:P54 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAyrton Senna, also known as Senna, Ayrton Senna da Silva (wd:Q10490): Brazilian racing driver (1960-1994), racing automobile driver, Formula One driver, businessperson, philanthropist\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as wdt): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat books did jules verne wright?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q47461344 ; wdt:P50 wd:Q33977 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJules Verne, also known as Jules Gabriel Verne, Julius Verne (wd:Q33977): French writer (1828\u20131905), science fiction writer, children's writer, Esperantist, playwright, novelist, writer, poet\nwritten work, also known as creative written work, written delivery (wd:Q47461344): any work expressed in writing, such as inscriptions, manuscripts, documents or maps\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator", "tool_call_id": "523e779920f642b4946b180dc897f49b"}, {"content": "The question is about important holidays of Islam.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who does mila kunis play on family guy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "216e410be5184699bc5a0dcfb73f523f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the senator of the united states 2010?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q4416090 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited States senator, also known as U.S. senator, US senator (wd:Q4416090): member of the United States Senate\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat are taylor swift's albums?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 ; wdt:P175 wd:Q26876 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTaylor Swift, also known as Taylor Alison Swift (wd:Q26876): American singer-songwriter (born 1989), music video director, singer-songwriter, record producer, philanthropist, film director, lyricist, composer, singer, actor\nalbum, also known as full album, record album, music album, full-length album, audio album (wd:Q482994): grouping of album releases by an artist usually released at the ...racks but in different formats for consumption (digital, CD, LP)\n\nUsing properties:\nperformer, also known as actor, sung by, singer, recording by, recorded by (wd:P175 as wdt): actor, musician, band or other performer associated with this role or musical work, contributor to the creative work or subject\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is mitsubishi headquarters?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q183275 wdt:P159 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMitsubishi, also known as Mitsubishi Companies, Mitsubishi Group of Companies (wd:Q183275): group of autonomous, Japanese multinational companies\n\nUsing properties:\nheadquarters location, also known as headquarters locality, seat, headquarters town, HQ, HQ location (wd:P159 as wdt): city or town where an organization's headquarters is or has been situated.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where do john lennon die?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "907d71f460834b42839e8e9958f16326", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat did bruce jenner win gold for?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q365144 p:P1344 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P1344 ?x ; pq:P166 wd:Q15243387 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nOlympic gold medal (wd:Q15243387): first-place medal awarded to Olympic Games participants\nCaitlyn Jenner (wd:Q365144): American media personality and retired decathlete, racing automobile driver, motivational speaker, athletics competitor, sports commentator, television actor, businessperson, film producer, actor, model\n\nUsing properties:\nparticipant in, also known as participated in, present at, takes part, took part, took part in (wd:P1344 as p/ps): event in which a person or organization was/is a participant; inverse of P710 or P1923, significant event, part of\naward received, also known as win, winner of, recognition title, received award, prize received (wd:P166 as pq): award or recognition received by a person, organization or creative work\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen did the 7th harry potter book come out?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q46758 wdt:P577 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, also known as last Harry Potter book (wd:Q46758): fantasy novel by J.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the title of george bush's new book?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "5549b14df4fa4113bd28448917663bbf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat killed sammy davis jr?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q297816 wdt:P509 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSammy Davis Jr., also known as Samuel George Davis Jr., Sammy Davis Jr (wd:Q297816): American entertainer (1925\u20131990), vaudeville performer, television presenter, television actor, recording artist, autobiographer, jazz musician, entertainer, stage actor, film actor, singer, dancer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncause of death, also known as death cause, murder method, method of murder, die of, die from (wd:P509 as wdt): underlying or immediate cause of death.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what team did aguero play for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "80db71d5b075401faa71ba3f07fdec85", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat instruments does john williams use?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q370293 wdt:P1303 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn Williams (wd:Q370293): Australian classical guitarist, classical guitarist, performing artist, music educator, composer\n\nUsing properties:\ninstrument, also known as uses this instrument, teaches instrument, instruments, plays this instrument, plays instrument (wd:P1303 as wdt): musical instrument that a person plays or teaches or used in a music occupation, uses\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat shows did kellie martin star in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P161 wd:Q235754 .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q5398426 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKellie Martin, also known as Kellie Noelle Martin (wd:Q235754): American actress, television actor, film director, voice actor, film actor, actor\ntelevision series, also known as TV show, TV-series, television show, TV series (wd:Q5398426): connected set of television program episodes under the same title\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as wdt): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho owns skywest?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q773662 wdt:P749 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSkyWest Airlines, also known as United Express (wd:Q773662): American regional airline\n\nUsing properties:\nparent organization, also known as parent company, parent institution, parent organisation, parent unit, part of (wd:P749 as wdt): parent organization of an organization, opposite of subsidiaries (P355), owned by, part of", "tool_call_id": "80db71d5b075401faa71ba3f07fdec85"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query for teams or shows a person was part of using properties like \"cast member\" or \"parent organization.\" For a football player like Aguero, we want to find the teams he played for.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is chesapeake bay bridge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "aea090ba327742bb9149a5132d43a5cb", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is located in the balkan peninsula?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q23522 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBalkans, also known as The Balkans, South Balkan area, Peninsula of Haemus, Balkanoid, Haemus Peninsula (wd:Q23522): geopolitical and cultural region of Southeast Europe\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did stephenie meyer play in twilight?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q160071 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 wd:Q160219 ; pq:P453 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTwilight (wd:Q160071): 2008 American film directed by Catherine Hardwicke\nStephenie Meyer, also known as Stephenie Morgan Meyer (wd:Q160219): science fiction writer, film screenwriter, children's writer, American author, businessperson, film producer, screenwriter, entrepreneur, novelist, writer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat to do if you have one day in bangkok?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q1861 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBangkok, also known as Bangkok, Thailand, Sia-Yut'hia, Krungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanak...it Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, Krung Thep (wd:Q1861): capital of Thailand\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "aea090ba327742bb9149a5132d43a5cb"}, {"content": "The question is \"where is Chesapeake Bay Bridge?\" We want to find the location of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\n\nStep 1: Identify the entity \"Chesapeake Bay Bridge\" in Wikidata.\nStep 2: Find the property that indicates the location of the bridge.\n\nI will start by searching for the entity \"Chesapeake Bay Bridge\" in Wikidata.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Chesapeake Bay Bridge\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_fcyJuebUUifQLivxfRfxVawx", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the predominant religion in israel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1c08cbfed08f49bf83e18590d76b2dcf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is the currency used in tunisia?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q948 wdt:P38 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTunisia, also known as Republic of Tunisia, tn, TUN, Tunisian Republic (wd:Q948): country in North Africa\n\nUsing properties:\ncurrency, also known as base currency, used money (wd:P38 as wdt): currency used by item, uses\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat is molly ringwald in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P161 wd:Q231460 ; wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q11424 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfilm, also known as cinematic work, moving picture, movie, motion pictures, motion picture (wd:Q11424): sequence of images that give the impression of movement, stored on film stock\nMolly Ringwald, also known as Molly Kathleen Ringwald (wd:Q231460): American actress, singer and author (1968-), translator, film actor, novelist, singer, dancer, writer\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as wdt): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of government system does canada have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q16 wdt:P122 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCanada, also known as CA, CAN, Dominion of Canada, ISO 3166-1:CA (wd:Q16): country in North America\n\nUsing properties:\nbasic form of government, also known as form of government, government, type of government (wd:P122 as wdt): subject's government", "tool_call_id": "1c08cbfed08f49bf83e18590d76b2dcf"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query for a specific property of a country.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what team did peyton manning's dad play for?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "df98bd28c09e456b8685e7826a76698d", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do irish people speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q170826 wdt:P1412 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIrish people, also known as Gaels, Irish (wd:Q170826): Celtic people\n\nUsing properties:\nlanguages spoken, written or signed, also known as language of expression, language, wrote language, writes language, uses language (wd:P1412 as wdt): language(s) that a person or a people speaks, writes or signs, including the native language(s)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho is angelina jolie's husband?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q13909 wdt:P26 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAngelina Jolie, also known as Angelina Jolie Voight (wd:Q13909): American actress, philanthropist, actor, model\n\nUsing properties:\nspouse, also known as married partner, married to, marry, partner, spouses (wd:P26 as wdt): the subject has the object as their spouse (husband, wife, partn...etc.).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where do the seattle seahawks play?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "65c084194e6c43f39eb3e69d5f4b8d1e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the senator of the state of texas?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q4416090 .\n  ?p pq:P768 ?y .\n  ?y wdt:P131 wd:Q1439 .\n  FILTER NOT EXISTS {\n    ?p pq:P582 ?z .\n  }\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTexas, also known as Lone Star State, US-TX, TX, Texas, United States, Tex.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of airport in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "55e82c8dbf2849808214476a6d4695d6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat books has elie wiesel written?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q47461344 ; wdt:P50 wd:Q18391 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nElie Wiesel, also known as \u00c9lie Wiesel, Eliezer Wiesel, A-7713 (wd:Q18391): Romanian-born American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel laureate, and Holocaust survivor (1928-2016), association football player, political activist, university teacher, Judaic scholar, autobiographer, philosopher, translator, journalist, playwright, architect, novelist, humanist, writer\nwritten work, also known as creative written work, written delivery (wd:Q47461344): any work expressed in writing, such as inscriptions, manuscripts, documents or maps\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was joseph pulitzer and what did he do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q173417 wdt:P106 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJoseph Pulitzer, also known as j. pulitzer, Pulitzer Jozsef, Joseph \"Joe\" Pulitzer, Pulitzer J\u00f3zsef, Josef Pollitzer (wd:Q173417): Hungarian-American newspaper publisher and politician (1847-1911), newspaper proprietor, politician, journalist, publisher, writer\n\nUsing properties:\noccupation, also known as job, work, vocation, profession, employment (wd:P106 as wdt): occupation of a person; see also \"field of work\" (Property:P101), \"position held\" (Property:P39)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nduring what war did abraham lincoln serve as president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q91 p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q198 ; wdt:P580 ?w ; wdt:P582 ?v .\n  FILTER ( ( ( ?w < ?z ) && ( ?w >= ?y ) ) || ( ( ?v < ?z ) && ( ?v >= ?y ) ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nwar, also known as hostilities, military conflict, wars (wd:Q198): organized and prolonged violent conflict between states\nAbraham Lincoln, also known as President Lincoln, Uncle Abe, Honest Abe, Abe Lincoln (wd:Q91): president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, military officer, statesperson, postmaster, politician, farmer, writer, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq/wdt): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq/wdt): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time", "tool_call_id": "55e82c8dbf2849808214476a6d4695d6"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly relate to airports or cities, so I will now search for the entity \"New York\" to find its Wikidata identifier.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what school did karl benz go to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "31bf65b3574040379a38a48d08f9ab43", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat year did michael jordan started his career?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q41421 wdt:P2031 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Jordan, also known as His Airness, Air Jordan (wd:Q41421): American basketball player and businessman (born 1963), basketball player, baseball player, autobiographer, spokesperson, entrepreneur\n\nUsing properties:\nwork period (start), also known as start working, flourished (start), start time for work, start date of activity, fl.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who does the voice for chucky in child's play?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "0049a7b2235946e0bb712ec281b5940e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did marco rubio go to college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q324546 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMarco Rubio, also known as Sec.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did margaret hoover go to college?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "3ed92de088334fa28ad09a3fc108a735", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did bob dylan live?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q392 wdt:P551 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBob Dylan, also known as Robert Milkwood Thomas, Robert Dylan n\u00e9 Robert Allen Zimmerman, Robert Zimmerman, Robert Dylan, Robert Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman) (wd:Q392): American singer-songwriter (born 1941), radio personality, record producer, autobiographer, film director, screenwriter, disc jockey, film actor, songwriter, guitarist, lyricist, designer, musician, composer, painter, writer, singer, actor, poet\n\nUsing properties:\nresidence, also known as living in, place of residence, resided at, resided in, resident in (wd:P551 as wdt): the place where the person is or has been, resident, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do people speak in iceland?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q189 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIceland, also known as Republic of Iceland, ISL (wd:Q189): Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere did pauley perrette go to college?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q231815 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPauley Perrette (wd:Q231815): American actress and musician, television actor, film producer, film director, voice actor, film actor, blogger, writer, actor, poet\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation", "tool_call_id": "3ed92de088334fa28ad09a3fc108a735"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that the property \"educated at\" (wdt:P69) is used to find the college or educational institution a person attended.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where was bin laden found and killed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "205695de07024d348c26eee1803ea763", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did james baldwin go to school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q273210 wdt:P69 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJames Baldwin, also known as James Arthur Baldwin (wd:Q273210): American writer (1924\u20131987), civil rights advocate, university teacher, short story writer, gay fiction writer, social critic, screenwriter, playwright, novelist, essayist, poet\n\nUsing properties:\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat all does google have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q95 wdt:P1830 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGoogle, also known as Big G, google.com, Google Inc., Google LLC, Google, Inc.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what movies have robert pattinson in them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f1cfdb247bee49eabc2ed1aa7bd85666", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is julia gillard party?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q41563 wdt:P102 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJulia Gillard, also known as Julia Eileen Gillard, The Honourable Julia Gillard MP, Prime Minister Gillard (wd:Q41563): Prime Minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013, politician, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of political party, also known as political party member, political party, party membership, party, member of party (wd:P102 as wdt): the political party of which a person is or has been a member or otherwise affiliated, member of\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat country columbus was born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q7322 wdt:P19 ?p .\n  ?p wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChristopher Columbus, also known as Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, Cristoforo Colombo, Don Cristob\u00e1l Col\u00f3n, 'Christopher Columbus', Cristobal Colon, Christofer Columbus (wd:Q7322): Italian navigator, explorer, and colonist (1451\u20131506), explorer, seafarer, traveler, inventor, sailor\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is kia car from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q35349 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKia, also known as Kia motors, Kyungsung Precision Industry, KN, Kia Motors Corporation (Seoul), Kia Motors (wd:Q35349): South Korean automobile manufacturer\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity", "tool_call_id": "f1cfdb247bee49eabc2ed1aa7bd85666"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query for entities related to a person or an object using their Wikidata ID and properties.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what language do most people speak in afghanistan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "f4d7ef5f8d384b7a8c600499691bf5b1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat songs does katherine jenkins sing?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P175 wd:Q272581 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKatherine Jenkins, also known as Katherine Maria Jenkins, Catherine Maria Jenkins (wd:Q272581): Welsh classical crossover singer, opera singer, music artist\n\nUsing properties:\nperformer, also known as actor, sung by, singer, recording by, recorded by (wd:P175 as wdt): actor, musician, band or other performer associated with this role or musical work, contributor to the creative work or subject\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did robbie hummel go to high school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1571580 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q9826 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRobbie Hummel, also known as Robert John Hummel (wd:Q1571580): American basketball player, basketball player\nhigh school, also known as H.S., upper middle school, senior high school, HS (wd:Q9826): institution which provides all or part of secondary education\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat religions are in russia?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q159 wdt:P3075 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRussia, also known as Russian Federation, RUS, RU, RF, ISO 3166-1:RU (wd:Q159): country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial religion, also known as established religion, state religion (wd:P3075 as wdt): official religion in this administrative entity", "tool_call_id": "f4d7ef5f8d384b7a8c600499691bf5b1"}, {"content": "The question is about the language most people speak in Afghanistan.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who do islamic people pray to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "35214681caa84ffdacf89d502b1575e9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat has lucy hale played in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P161 wd:Q229940 ; wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q11424 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfilm, also known as cinematic work, moving picture, movie, motion pictures, motion picture (wd:Q11424): sequence of images that give the impression of movement, stored on film stock\nLucy Hale, also known as Lucy Kate Hale, Karen Lucille Hale (wd:Q229940): American actress and singer, television actor, songwriter, film actor, musician, designer, singer, actor, model\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as wdt): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat team did mike piazza retire with?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q613319 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P582 ?y .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?y )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nMike Piazza, also known as Michael Joseph Piazza (wd:Q613319): American Hall of Fame baseball player, baseball manager, sports executive, baseball player\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as p/ps): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is the fukushima daiichi located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q114295 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, also known as Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, Fukushima Dai-ichi (wd:Q114295): nuclear power plant in Japan\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of", "tool_call_id": "35214681caa84ffdacf89d502b1575e9"}, {"content": "The question is \"Who do Islamic people pray to?\" This is a question about the religious belief of Islam and the entity to whom prayers are directed.\n\nStep 1: Identify the entity \"Islam\" in Wikidata.\nStep 2: Identify the concept of prayer or praying in Wikidata.\nStep 3: Find the entity or entities that Islamic people pray to.\n\nI will start by searching for the entity \"Islam\" in Wikidata.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Islam\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_78DVRhY6Ui3Hwt5r4QHYbBQ4", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what can do in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "837064274298403cbd607e3d5fc28bf0", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat are the major languages spoken in italy?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q38 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItaly, also known as Italia, Republic of Italy, Repubblica Italiana, Italian Republic, ITA (wd:Q38): country in Southern Europe\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat states does the missouri river touch?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q5419 wdt:P131 + ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q107390 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfederated state, also known as state in a federation, state of a federation, state, federal state, constituent state (wd:Q107390): territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federal union\nMissouri River, also known as Missouri, The Missouri (wd:Q5419): major river in central United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is somalia located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1045 wdt:P30 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSomalia, also known as so, Federal Republic of Somalia, SOM (wd:Q1045): sovereign state in Africa\n\nUsing properties:\ncontinent (wd:P30 as wdt): continent of which the subject is a part, located in/on physical feature", "tool_call_id": "837064274298403cbd607e3d5fc28bf0"}, {"content": "The question \"what can do in New York?\" is asking about activities or things to do in New York.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what materials did eduardo paolozzi use in his work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "fcf6c88d72af42518d36cd950285d7fd", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhich countries border the us?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q30 wdt:P47 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited States, also known as the U.S. of A, United States of America, the US of America, United States of North America, U.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is nineveh city?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "34b2fa4b3e514535ac2e0226e4be0b4f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is my timezone in california?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q99 wdt:P421 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCalifornia, also known as US-CA, State of California, The Golden State, Calif., Cali.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who played captain kirk in star trek movie?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "7cef99b3425d499583a3318011df7ea9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did the welsh language originate from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9309 wdt:P279 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nWelsh, also known as Cymric, y Gymraeg, Welsh language, Cymric language, Cymraeg (wd:Q9309): Brittonic language spoken natively in Wales\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho played obi wan kenobi in phantom menace?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q165713 p:P161 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q51740 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nStar Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace, also known as Star Wars Episode I, Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace, The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace (wd:Q165713): 1999 film directed by George Lucas\nObi-Wan Kenobi, also known as Master Kenobi, Obi Wan Kenobi, Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi, Obi-Wan, Obi Wan (wd:Q51740): fictional character in the Star Wars universe, Jedi\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat is nina dobrev nationality?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q183439 wdt:P27 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nNina Dobrev, also known as Nikolina Kamenova Dobreva (wd:Q183439): Bulgarian-Canadian actress, executive producer, television actor, ballet dancer, film director, entrepreneur, voice actor, film actor, gymnast, dancer, model, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry of citizenship, also known as subject of (country), nation of citizenship, national of, nationality, nation (wd:P27 as wdt): the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen, country", "tool_call_id": "7cef99b3425d499583a3318011df7ea9"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that to find who played a character in a movie, we can use the property \"cast member\" (wdt:P161) with a qualifier \"character role\" (pq:P453) to specify the character. \n\nStep 1: I will search for the entity \"Star Trek movie\" to identify the specific movie entity in Wikidata.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Star Trek movie\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_VMPCgdKEiBehKoLQ1bdQ9sGA", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
