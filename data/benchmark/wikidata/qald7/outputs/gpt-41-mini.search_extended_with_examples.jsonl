Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me all soccer clubs in Spain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "df580d423c95431b920028cdc94f7bdc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Give me all soccer clubs in Spain.\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nGive me all soccer clubs in the Premier League.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 .\n  ?uri wdt:P118 wd:Q9448 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nassociation football club, also known as association soccer club, F.C., FC, football club, soccer club (wd:Q476028): sports club devoted to association football (soccer)\nPremier League, also known as England Premier League, English Premier League, English Premiership, EPL, PL (wd:Q9448): English men's association football top league\n\nUsing properties:\nleague or competition, also known as tournament, sports league, division, cup, competition (wd:P118 as wdt): league or competition in which team or player has played, or in which an event occurs, participant in\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the biggest stadium in Spain?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q483110 .\n  } UNION {\n    ?uri wdt:P31 ?type .\n    ?type wdt:P279 wd:Q483110\n  }\n  ?uri wdt:P17 wd:Q29 .\n  ?uri wdt:P1083 ?num .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?num )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nSpain, also known as Kingdom of Spain (wd:Q29): country in southwestern Europe with territories in Africa\nstadium, also known as sports arena, sports stadium, sport stadium, stadiums, \ud83c\udfdf\ufe0f (wd:Q483110): place or venue for (mostly) outdoor sports, concerts, or other events\n\nUsing properties:\nmaximum capacity, also known as capacity, complement, crew, number of seats, seating capacity (wd:P1083 as wdt): number of people allowed for a venue or vehicle\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nGive me all South American countries.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 .\n  ?uri wdt:P30 wd:Q18 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSouth America, also known as S America, S.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the highest mountain in Australia?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "afeff4a834d245b78f883edbba1541f9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the highest mountain in Australia?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "afeff4a834d245b78f883edbba1541f9"}, {"content": "No similar examples were found for this question.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which mountain is the highest after the Annapurna?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "dc2033b7d80047be8ebe6d8ca036dd9c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Which mountain is the highest after the Annapurna?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "dc2033b7d80047be8ebe6d8ca036dd9c"}, {"content": "There are no similar example queries available.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "List all episodes of the first season of the HBO television series The Sopranos."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "933b28fbd6324cf9abf4814bce99823c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"List all episodes of the first season of the HBO television series The Sopranos.\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "933b28fbd6324cf9abf4814bce99823c"}, {"content": "There are no direct examples available for this question.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me all cities in New Jersey with more than 100000 inhabitants."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1b00b815492c41a795c06389a84940c4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Give me all cities in New Jersey with more than 100000 inhabitants.\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nShow me all U.S. states.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q35657 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nU.S. state, also known as U.S. states, US state, USA state, U.S.A. state, United States states (wd:Q35657): constituent political entity of the United States of America\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nGive me all soccer clubs in the Premier League.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q476028 .\n  ?uri wdt:P118 wd:Q9448 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nassociation football club, also known as association soccer club, F.C., FC, football club, soccer club (wd:Q476028): sports club devoted to association football (soccer)\nPremier League, also known as England Premier League, English Premier League, English Premiership, EPL, PL (wd:Q9448): English men's association football top league\n\nUsing properties:\nleague or competition, also known as tournament, sports league, division, cup, competition (wd:P118 as wdt): league or competition in which team or player has played, or in which an event occurs, participant in\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat are the five boroughs of New York?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q408804 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nborough of New York City, also known as Five Boroughs, borough of the City of New York (wd:Q408804): administrative division of New York City, United States of America, administrative division of New York City, USA\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "1b00b815492c41a795c06389a84940c4"}, {"content": "From the examples, we see that to find cities in a specific state, we need to use the property \"instance of\" (wdt:P31) for cities and the property \"located in the administrative territorial entity\" (wdt:P131) for the state.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
