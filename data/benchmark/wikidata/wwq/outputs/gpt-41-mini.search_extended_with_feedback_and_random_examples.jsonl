Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what has shannen doherty played in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a5c2dab43bba40f89989649eec236ee0", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat time zone is birmingham england?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q2256 wdt:P421 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBirmingham, also known as Birmingham, England, Birmingham, West Midlands, Birmingham, UK (wd:Q2256): city in West Midlands, England\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in time zone, also known as TZ, time zone, timezone (wd:P421 as wdt): time zone for this item\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen did miami dolphins win super bowl?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?y wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q32096 ; wdt:P1346 wd:Q223243 ; wdt:P585 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMiami Dolphins, also known as Dolphins, Miami (wd:Q223243): National Football League franchise in Miami, Florida\nSuper Bowl, also known as AFL\u2013NFL World Championship Game (wd:Q32096): National Football League championship game\n\nUsing properties:\nwinner, also known as nominee, prizewinner, titleholder, top dog, victor (wd:P1346 as wdt): winner of a competition or similar event, not to be used for awa...ssibly qualified with \"for work\" (P1686)) or for wars or battles, participating team, participant\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\npoint in time, also known as at time, as of, year, when, time of event (wd:P585 as wdt): date something took place, existed or a statement was true; for providing time use the \"refine date\" property (P4241)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat did george eastman make?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P61 wd:Q189147 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGeorge Eastman, also known as geog. eastman, g. eastman, Geo.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is steve nash nationality?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "0e1ed51177db4e23a0d735e79ef39b1f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere did dolly parton grew up?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q180453 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDolly Parton, also known as Dolly Rebecca Parton, Dolly Parton Dean (wd:Q180453): American singer, songwriter and actress, multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, television actor, recording artist, country musician, record producer, autobiographer, businessperson, country singer, film producer, screenwriter, voice actor, songwriter, film actor, guitarist, composer, banjoist, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho are the judges of the supreme court?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P39 ?y .\n  ?y wdt:P279 wd:Q20706330 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited States Supreme Court justice, also known as Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, Justices of the United States Supreme Court (wd:Q20706330): Chief Justice and associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as wdt): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does dominic monaghan play in lord of the rings?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q127367 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 wd:Q152165 ; pq:P453 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, also known as Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Fellowship of the Ring (wd:Q127367): 2001 film by Peter Jackson\nDominic Monaghan (wd:Q152165): German-born British actor, television actor, screenwriter, stage actor, film actor, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)", "tool_call_id": "0e1ed51177db4e23a0d735e79ef39b1f"}, {"content": "The question is about the nationality of Steve Nash.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who are the virginia senators 2013?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d9d382a4bfd54f8fae2f2708c8f2e41c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhere was the gettysburg war located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q33132 wdt:P276 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBattle of Gettysburg (wd:Q33132): 1863 battle of the American Civil War\n\nUsing properties:\nlocation, also known as neighbourhood, whereabouts, vilage, venue, town (wd:P276 as wdt): location of the object, structure or event.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where did emperor hirohito live?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1cb849a242344db2a557faa32e5d1453", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho will michael schumacher drive for in 2013?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9671 p:P54 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P54 ?x ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMichael Schumacher, also known as Schuey, Schumi (wd:Q9671): German racing driver, Formula One driver, motorcycle racer\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of sports team, also known as plays for, played for, sport team, team, team played for (wd:P54 as p/ps): sports teams or clubs that the subject represents or represented, member of\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat character does ellen play in finding nemo?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q132863 p:P725 ?p .\n  ?p pq:P453 ?x .\n  ?p ps:P725 wd:Q483325 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFinding Nemo, also known as Nemo (wd:Q132863): 2003 American animated film\nEllen DeGeneres, also known as Ellen Lee DeGeneres (wd:Q483325): American comedian, television host, actress, and writer (born 1958), LGBTQ rights activist, television presenter, television producer, television actor, talk show host, screenwriter, voice actor, film actor, presenter, comedian, writer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\nvoice actor, also known as voice actors, voice dubber, voice actress, voice actresses, voiced by (wd:P725 as p/ps): performer of a spoken role in a creative work such as animation,...

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are some of leonardo da vinci most famous inventions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "14d53dd0266e4d1ea9567ac55b004d54", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho plays lois lane in superman returns?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q328695 p:P161 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q845922 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSuperman Returns (wd:Q328695): 2006 film directed by Bryan Singer\nLois Lane (wd:Q845922): fictional character in DC comics, journalist, reporter\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere was the battle of vicksburg located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1066253 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSiege of Vicksburg, also known as Battle of Vicksburg, Fall of Vicksburg (wd:Q1066253): 1863 battle of the American Civil War's Anaconda Plan\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat can you do in palm springs ca?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q488004 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPalm Springs, also known as Palm City, Palm Springs, CA, Palm Springs, California (wd:Q488004): resort city in Riverside County, southern California, United States\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "14d53dd0266e4d1ea9567ac55b004d54"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly address inventions by Leonardo da Vinci, so I will now search for the entity \"Leonardo da Vinci\" in Wikidata to get his identifier.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when the atlanta braves won the world series?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "0a6b0d3de43144038febb46b5fac68cf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\non which river is paris?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q573344 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q90 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nmain stream, also known as main stem, mainstem, river, trunk, veletok (wd:Q573344): final large channel of a riverine system\nParis, also known as City of Love, Lutetia, City of Light (wd:Q90): capital city and largest city of France\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho is the governor of colorado 2009?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q29514964 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGovernor of Colorado, also known as Colorado Governor, Governor of the State of Colorado (wd:Q29514964): head of state and of government of the U.S. state of Colorado\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat war was george washington associated with?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q23 wdt:P607 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGeorge Washington, also known as Father of the United States (wd:Q23): Founding Father and first U.S. president (1789\u20131797), revolutionary, statesperson, army officer, cartographer, politician, engineer, geometer, writer, farmer\n\nUsing properties:\nconflict, also known as war, theatre (military), theater (military), participated in conflict, military conflict (wd:P607 as wdt): battles, wars or other military engagements in which the person or item participated, participant in", "tool_call_id": "0a6b0d3de43144038febb46b5fac68cf"}, {"content": "From the examples, I see that to find when an entity won an event, we need to identify the entity (Atlanta Braves) and the event (World Series) and then find the property that relates the entity to the event with a time qualifier or statement.\n\nStep 1: Search for the entity \"Atlanta Braves\" in Wikidata.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Atlanta Braves\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_wTjJSf6VtwHb01APj7qCVHEA", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what was john tyler?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "58c5065d3b4843f9bf695849f4d685b5", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho played mickey on days of our lives?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q185059 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q2094650 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDays of Our Lives, also known as Days of our Lives, DOOL, Days (wd:Q185059): American daytime soap opera\nMickey Horton (wd:Q2094650): Fictional Character of Days of Our Lives\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat do singapore speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q334 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSingapore, also known as SIN, S'pore, Singapore City, SGP, SG (wd:Q334): sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat did florence sabin do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q449487 wdt:P106 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFlorence R.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what movies did david carradine play in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1d67ed030c3a4f0bbbec52e40b169083", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat films have johnny depp been in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P161 wd:Q37175 ; wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q11424 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfilm, also known as cinematic work, moving picture, movie, motion pictures, motion picture (wd:Q11424): sequence of images that give the impression of movement, stored on film stock\nJohnny Depp, also known as John Christopher \"Johnny\" Depp II, John Christopher Depp, John Christopher Depp II, John Depp, John C.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what to see in phoenix arizona?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d9ea896c355c43d3a3e9bc510cde02c0", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat university did bill clinton graduated from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1124 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q38723 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBill Clinton, also known as William Jefferson Blythe, William Jefferson Blythe III, William Jefferson \"Bill\" Clinton, William Jefferson Clinton, WJC (wd:Q1124): President of the United States from 1993 to 2001, autobiographer, statesperson, saxophonist, politician, governor, diplomat, teacher, jurist, lawyer, writer\nhigher education institution, also known as HEI, Higher Education school, institution of higher education, Superior Institute (wd:Q38723): institution that provides higher education (e.g., universities, ...es, liberal arts colleges, institutes of technology, and others)\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat religions are in russia?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q159 wdt:P3075 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nRussia, also known as Russian Federation, RUS, RU, RF, ISO 3166-1:RU (wd:Q159): country in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial religion, also known as established religion, state religion (wd:P3075 as wdt): official religion in this administrative entity\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does leia think her father is?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q51797 wdt:P22 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPrincess Leia, also known as Princess Leia Organa, Leia Organa Solo, Leia Organa, Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, General Organa (wd:Q51797): fictional character from Star Wars, starship pilot, politician, diplomat, impostor, rebel, Jedi, spy\n\nUsing properties:\nfather, also known as son of, child of, parent, is son of, is daughter of (wd:P22 as wdt): male parent of the subject.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is kevin jonas married to?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "993da63aa8f143b592192989b6e8a76f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhich province is calgary canada in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q36312 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCalgary, also known as Calgary, AB, Calgary, Alberta, Calgary, Canada, City of Calgary (wd:Q36312): largest city in Alberta, Canada\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhen was reagan inaugurated?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9960 p:P39 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nRonald Reagan, also known as Ronald W Reagan, Ronald W.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who does mila kunis play on family guy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "71a59711787f42dcbed2d3d0666c1016", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the senator of the united states 2010?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q4416090 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited States senator, also known as U.S. senator, US senator (wd:Q4416090): member of the United States Senate\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat are taylor swift's albums?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 ; wdt:P175 wd:Q26876 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTaylor Swift, also known as Taylor Alison Swift (wd:Q26876): American singer-songwriter (born 1989), music video director, singer-songwriter, record producer, philanthropist, film director, lyricist, composer, singer, actor\nalbum, also known as full album, record album, music album, full-length album, audio album (wd:Q482994): grouping of album releases by an artist usually released at the ...racks but in different formats for consumption (digital, CD, LP)\n\nUsing properties:\nperformer, also known as actor, sung by, singer, recording by, recorded by (wd:P175 as wdt): actor, musician, band or other performer associated with this role or musical work, contributor to the creative work or subject\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is mitsubishi headquarters?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q183275 wdt:P159 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMitsubishi, also known as Mitsubishi Companies, Mitsubishi Group of Companies (wd:Q183275): group of autonomous, Japanese multinational companies\n\nUsing properties:\nheadquarters location, also known as headquarters locality, seat, headquarters town, HQ, HQ location (wd:P159 as wdt): city or town where an organization's headquarters is or has been situated.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what does gm make?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ede3e3df39c540e4addc6345bd6b7bb8", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of currency does cuba use?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q241 wdt:P38 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nCuba, also known as cu, CUB, Republic of Cuba (wd:Q241): sovereign state situated on an island in the Caribbean Sea\n\nUsing properties:\ncurrency, also known as base currency, used money (wd:P38 as wdt): currency used by item, uses\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat county is morristown tn in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q962499 wdt:P131 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMorristown, also known as Morristown, New Jersey, Morristown, NJ (wd:Q962499): town in Morris County, New Jersey, United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwho does dominic monaghan play in lord of the rings?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q127367 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 wd:Q152165 ; pq:P453 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, also known as Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Fellowship of the Ring (wd:Q127367): 2001 film by Peter Jackson\nDominic Monaghan (wd:Q152165): German-born British actor, television actor, screenwriter, stage actor, film actor, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)", "tool_call_id": "ede3e3df39c540e4addc6345bd6b7bb8"}, {"content": "The question \"what does gm make?\" is ambiguous because \"gm\" could refer to different entities such as General Motors (the automobile manufacturer) or something else.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what the largest city in spain?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "bea3e447abfd42ecb8ffa80cf46c044b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho were demeter's brothers and sisters?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q40730 wdt:P3373 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDemeter, also known as D\u00eam\u00eat\u00ear, Deo (wd:Q40730): Greek goddess of the harvest, grains, and agriculture\n\nUsing properties:\nsibling, also known as is sister of, is the brother of, is the sibling of, is the sister of, sib (wd:P3373 as wdt): the subject and the object have at least one common parent (brot...law, etc.) and step-siblings (step-brothers, step-sisters, etc.), relative\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho played daniel larusso?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?p p:P161 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P161 ?x ; pq:P453 wd:Q55315887 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nDaniel LaRusso, also known as Daniel-san (wd:Q55315887): fictional character from the Karate Kid franchise, business executive, car dealer, karateka\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat did the habsburg family control?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q65968 wdt:P1830 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHouse of Habsburg, also known as Habsburg, Habsburg family, Hapsburg, Hapsburg family, House of Austria (wd:Q65968): Austrian imperial house\n\nUsing properties:\nowner of, also known as owns, owns property, shareholder of (wd:P1830 as wdt): entities owned by the subject", "tool_call_id": "bea3e447abfd42ecb8ffa80cf46c044b"}, {"content": "The question is about the largest city in Spain.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who did ben franklin marry?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "df813548e10a4e6589f32031494d62e8", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is shakespeare's parents names?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q692 wdt:P22 | wdt:P25 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nWilliam Shakespeare, also known as Bard of Avon, The Bard of Avon, The Bard, Swan of Avon (wd:Q692): English playwright and poet (1564\u20131616), playwright\n\nUsing properties:\nfather, also known as son of, child of, parent, is son of, is daughter of (wd:P22 as wdt): male parent of the subject.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what did jesus do for living?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a3751b2fe313483cb6540da5d7e33736", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat kind of language do they speak in china?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q148 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPeople's Republic of China, also known as Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3, The PRC, RPC, CHN, Red China (wd:Q148): country in East Asia\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was wale signed to?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q458519 wdt:P264 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nWale, also known as Olubowale Akintimehin (wd:Q458519): American rapper, songwriter, rapper, singer\n\nUsing properties:\nrecord label, also known as label, labels (wd:P264 as wdt): brand and trademark associated with the marketing of subject music recordings and music videos\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat religion is king henry viii?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q38370 wdt:P140 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHenry VIII of England, also known as Henry VIII, Henry the Eighth, Henry Tudor (wd:Q38370): King of England from 1509 until 1547, composer, monarch\n\nUsing properties:\nreligion or worldview, also known as believes, worldview, religious affiliation, religion or world view, religion (wd:P140 as wdt): religion of a person, organization or religious building, or associated with this subject", "tool_call_id": "a3751b2fe313483cb6540da5d7e33736"}, {"content": "The question \"what did Jesus do for living?\" is asking about the occupation or profession of Jesus.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "where is chesapeake bay bridge?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "bb42c26800bb4a0d859baedbbc6a9e8a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country is located in the balkan peninsula?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q23522 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBalkans, also known as The Balkans, South Balkan area, Peninsula of Haemus, Balkanoid, Haemus Peninsula (wd:Q23522): geopolitical and cultural region of Southeast Europe\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho did stephenie meyer play in twilight?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q160071 p:P161 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P161 wd:Q160219 ; pq:P453 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nTwilight (wd:Q160071): 2008 American film directed by Catherine Hardwicke\nStephenie Meyer, also known as Stephenie Morgan Meyer (wd:Q160219): science fiction writer, film screenwriter, children's writer, American author, businessperson, film producer, screenwriter, entrepreneur, novelist, writer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as p/ps): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ncharacter role, also known as role, plays, performer of, as, acting role (wd:P453 as pq): specific role played or filled by subject -- use only as qualifier of \"cast member\" (P161), \"voice actor\" (P725)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat to do if you have one day in bangkok?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q1861 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBangkok, also known as Bangkok, Thailand, Sia-Yut'hia, Krungthepmahanakhon Amonrattanak...it Sakkathattiyawitsanukamprasit, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, Krung Thep (wd:Q1861): capital of Thailand\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "bb42c26800bb4a0d859baedbbc6a9e8a"}, {"content": "The question is \"where is Chesapeake Bay Bridge?\" We want to find the location of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\n\nStep 1: Identify the entity \"Chesapeake Bay Bridge\" in Wikidata.\nStep 2: Find the property that indicates the location of the bridge.\n\nI will start by searching for the entity \"Chesapeake Bay Bridge\" in Wikidata.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Chesapeake Bay Bridge\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_GeJt6LxzCfX1AFhDw6zq3mJ5", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what does helen flanagan do?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "612fdbda435840a789147adec1e4730c", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat movies have robert pattinson starred in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P161 wd:Q36767 ; wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q11424 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfilm, also known as cinematic work, moving picture, movie, motion pictures, motion picture (wd:Q11424): sequence of images that give the impression of movement, stored on film stock\nRobert Pattinson, also known as Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson (wd:Q36767): British actor and model, television actor, film producer, stage actor, film actor, composer, singer, actor, model\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as wdt): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat should i see in london england?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q570116 ; wdt:P131 wd:Q84 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\ntourist attraction, also known as attraction for tourists, POI for tourists, tourism attraction, touristic attraction, tourist place (wd:Q570116): place of interest where tourists visit\nLondon, also known as Loniniensi, Trinovantum, the Big Smoke, Lundenwic, Lundenburh (wd:Q84): capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhich ocean does the murray river flow into?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q183078 wdt:P403 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMurray River, also known as River Murray, Indi Miky (wd:Q183078): river in Australia\n\nUsing properties:\nmouth of the watercourse, also known as flows into, watercourse outflow, watercourse ends in, watercourse drain, tributary of (wd:P403 as wdt): the body of water to which the watercourse drains", "tool_call_id": "612fdbda435840a789147adec1e4730c"}, {"content": "The examples show how to find what movies a person has starred in, what to see in a city, and where a river flows into.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what is the name of airport in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ac611834ef1745b9bc21d5967564e87b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat books has elie wiesel written?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q47461344 ; wdt:P50 wd:Q18391 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nElie Wiesel, also known as \u00c9lie Wiesel, Eliezer Wiesel, A-7713 (wd:Q18391): Romanian-born American writer, professor, political activist, Nobel laureate, and Holocaust survivor (1928-2016), association football player, political activist, university teacher, Judaic scholar, autobiographer, philosopher, translator, journalist, playwright, architect, novelist, humanist, writer\nwritten work, also known as creative written work, written delivery (wd:Q47461344): any work expressed in writing, such as inscriptions, manuscripts, documents or maps\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho was joseph pulitzer and what did he do?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q173417 wdt:P106 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJoseph Pulitzer, also known as j. pulitzer, Pulitzer Jozsef, Joseph \"Joe\" Pulitzer, Pulitzer J\u00f3zsef, Josef Pollitzer (wd:Q173417): Hungarian-American newspaper publisher and politician (1847-1911), newspaper proprietor, politician, journalist, publisher, writer\n\nUsing properties:\noccupation, also known as job, work, vocation, profession, employment (wd:P106 as wdt): occupation of a person; see also \"field of work\" (Property:P101), \"position held\" (Property:P39)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nduring what war did abraham lincoln serve as president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q91 p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  ?x wdt:P31 wd:Q198 ; wdt:P580 ?w ; wdt:P582 ?v .\n  FILTER ( ( ( ?w < ?z ) && ( ?w >= ?y ) ) || ( ( ?v < ?z ) && ( ?v >= ?y ) ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nwar, also known as hostilities, military conflict, wars (wd:Q198): organized and prolonged violent conflict between states\nAbraham Lincoln, also known as President Lincoln, Uncle Abe, Honest Abe, Abe Lincoln (wd:Q91): president of the United States from 1861 to 1865, military officer, statesperson, postmaster, politician, farmer, writer, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq/wdt): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq/wdt): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time", "tool_call_id": "ac611834ef1745b9bc21d5967564e87b"}, {"content": "The examples did not directly relate to airports or cities, so I will now search for the entity \"New York\" to get its identifier in Wikidata.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are the supreme court cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a4adae8d768c4092a2c4b4b02ae2115e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is leann rimes with now?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q120533 wdt:P26 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLeAnn Rimes, also known as LeAnn Rimes Cibrian, Margaret LeAnn Rimes Cibrian, Margaret LeAnn Rimes (wd:Q120533): American singer and actress (born 1982), songwriter, singer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nspouse, also known as married partner, married to, marry, partner, spouses (wd:P26 as wdt): the subject has the object as their spouse (husband, wife, partn...etc.).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who has played lex luthor?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "acdad18177d348808476ff4dbe47b617", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat was one of benjamin franklin's inventions?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x wdt:P61 wd:Q34969 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBenjamin Franklin, also known as The First American, Silence Dogood, Poor Richard, Ben Franklin, Franklin (wd:Q34969): American polymath and statesman (1706\u20131790), politician, polymath, diplomat, writer\n\nUsing properties:\ndiscoverer or inventor, also known as inventor or discoverer, inventor, invented by, invented, introduced by (wd:P61 as wdt): subject who discovered, first described, invented, or developed this discovery or invention or scientific hypothesis or theory\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhere did kobe bryant attend high school?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q25369 wdt:P69 ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q9826 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKobe Bryant, also known as Kobe Bean Bryant, Kobe B.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what town was martin luther king assassinated in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "101a314a24aa41249c35bf4773911f63", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of music is scott joplin?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q191499 wdt:P136 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nScott Joplin, also known as The king of Ragtime (wd:Q191499): American composer, musician, and pianist, jazz musician, banjoist, composer, pianist\n\nUsing properties:\ngenre, also known as genre of music, type of music, type of film, music genre, literary genre (wd:P136 as wdt): creative work's genre or an artist's field of work (P101).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "who is the prime minister of spain 2011?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "d0a21e6ef9214289b2e69a4d88bc51a7", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho was theodore roosevelt's vice president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q11699 ; pq:P580 ?y .\n  wd:Q33866 p:P39 ?q .\n  ?q ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ?y = ?z )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nVice President of the United States, also known as President of the Senate, President of the United States Senate, United States Vice President, United States VP, USA VP (wd:Q11699): second-highest constitutional office in the United States\nTheodore Roosevelt, also known as Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Teddy Roosevelt (wd:Q33866): 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909, husbandry worker, conservationist, autobiographer, ornithologist, statesperson, naturalist, politician, historian, explorer, essayist, diarist, writer\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat type of legal system does italy have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q38 wdt:P122 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItaly, also known as Italia, Republic of Italy, Repubblica Italiana, Italian Republic, ITA (wd:Q38): country in Southern Europe\n\nUsing properties:\nbasic form of government, also known as form of government, government, type of government (wd:P122 as wdt): subject's government\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do people speak in iran?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q794 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIran, also known as ir, IRI, IRN, Islamic Rep.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what movies have robert pattinson in them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ab672a7516b24abc99390a5a9187de01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat is julia gillard party?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q41563 wdt:P102 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJulia Gillard, also known as Julia Eileen Gillard, The Honourable Julia Gillard MP, Prime Minister Gillard (wd:Q41563): Prime Minister of Australia from 2010 to 2013, politician, lawyer\n\nUsing properties:\nmember of political party, also known as political party member, political party, party membership, party, member of party (wd:P102 as wdt): the political party of which a person is or has been a member or otherwise affiliated, member of\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat country columbus was born?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q7322 wdt:P19 ?p .\n  ?p wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nChristopher Columbus, also known as Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n, Cristoforo Colombo, Don Cristob\u00e1l Col\u00f3n, 'Christopher Columbus', Cristobal Colon, Christofer Columbus (wd:Q7322): Italian navigator, explorer, and colonist (1451\u20131506), explorer, seafarer, traveler, inventor, sailor\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\nplace of birth, also known as POB, location of birth, location born, born in, birthplace (wd:P19 as wdt): most specific known birth location of a person, animal or fictional character, location\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is kia car from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q35349 wdt:P17 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nKia, also known as Kia motors, Kyungsung Precision Industry, KN, Kia Motors Corporation (Seoul), Kia Motors (wd:Q35349): South Korean automobile manufacturer\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity", "tool_call_id": "ab672a7516b24abc99390a5a9187de01"}, {"content": "The examples show how to query for entities related to a person or an entity using properties.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what can do in new york?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "97fe92067f504aa695d4d45667b9efcf", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat are the major languages spoken in italy?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q38 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nItaly, also known as Italia, Republic of Italy, Repubblica Italiana, Italian Republic, ITA (wd:Q38): country in Southern Europe\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat states does the missouri river touch?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q5419 wdt:P131 + ?x .\n  ?x wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q107390 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfederated state, also known as state in a federation, state of a federation, state, federal state, constituent state (wd:Q107390): territorial and constitutional community forming part of a federal union\nMissouri River, also known as Missouri, The Missouri (wd:Q5419): major river in central United States\n\nUsing properties:\nlocated in the administrative territorial entity, also known as is in the settlement of, is in the voivodeship of, is in the shire of, is in the state of, is in the territory of (wd:P131 as wdt): the item is located on the territory of the following administra...if the item falls only partially into the administrative entity., location, part of\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere is somalia located?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q1045 wdt:P30 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSomalia, also known as so, Federal Republic of Somalia, SOM (wd:Q1045): sovereign state in Africa\n\nUsing properties:\ncontinent (wd:P30 as wdt): continent of which the subject is a part, located in/on physical feature", "tool_call_id": "97fe92067f504aa695d4d45667b9efcf"}, {"content": "The user asks \"what can do in New York?\" which is a broad question about activities or things to do in New York.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what materials did eduardo paolozzi use in his work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "e279197d7cff4074baeeaf6f8218dee4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhich countries border the us?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q30 wdt:P47 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nUnited States, also known as the U.S. of A, United States of America, the US of America, United States of North America, U.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what did john irving wrote?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "81d1ce0a59fc4097a309e3dd9844bacc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwhat country did vasco da gama come from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q7328 wdt:P27 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nVasco da Gama, also known as Count of Vidigueira (wd:Q7328): Portuguese explorer, world traveler, naval officer, explorer, seafarer\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry of citizenship, also known as subject of (country), nation of citizenship, national of, nationality, nation (wd:P27 as wdt): the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen, country\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwho is president of france?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q142 wdt:P6 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFrance, also known as FR, FRA, French Republic (wd:Q142): country in Western Europe\n\nUsing properties:\nhead of government, also known as head of national government, mayor, premier, president, prime minister (wd:P6 as wdt): head of the executive power of this town, city, municipality, state, country, or other governmental body, director / manager, chairperson\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhere was president lyndon johnson from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q9640 wdt:P19 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nLyndon B.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "what city does fulham play in?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "7ae6ad40492d49ed9e3b15924f9418e9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nwho is the leader of the dominican republic 2011?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  ?x p:P39 ?p .\n  ?p ps:P39 wd:Q607982 ; pq:P580 ?y ; pq:P582 ?z .\n  FILTER ( ( ?y < \"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) && ( ?z >= \"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z\" ^^ xsd:dateTime ) )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the Dominican Republic (wd:Q607982): Dominican head of state and head of government\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\nend time, also known as ends, stop time, endtime, fall date, ineffective (wd:P582 as pq): moment when an entity ceases to exist and a statement stops being entirely valid or no longer be true, point in time\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nwhat year did george washington become the president?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q23 p:P39 ?y .\n  ?y ps:P39 wd:Q11696 ; pq:P580 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nPresident of the United States, also known as US President, U.S. President, United States President, the president of the United States, President of the U.S. (wd:Q11696): head of state and head of government of the United States of America\nGeorge Washington, also known as Father of the United States (wd:Q23): Founding Father and first U.S. president (1789\u20131797), revolutionary, statesperson, army officer, cartographer, politician, engineer, geometer, writer, farmer\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as p/ps): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\nstart time, also known as start date, since, valid, join time, joined (wd:P580 as pq): time an entity begins to exist or a statement starts being valid, point in time\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nwhat language do haitian speak?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE {\n  wd:Q790 wdt:P37 ?x .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nHaiti, also known as Ayiti, HAI, Haitian Republic, Hayti, ht (wd:Q790): country in the Caribbean Sea\n\nUsing properties:\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used", "tool_call_id": "7ae6ad40492d49ed9e3b15924f9418e9"}, {"content": "The question is \"what city does Fulham play in?\" which refers to the football club Fulham and the city it is based in. \n\nStep 1: Identify the entity \"Fulham\" as a football club.\nStep 2: Identify the property that links a football club to the city it plays in or is based in.\n\nI will start by searching for the entity \"Fulham\" in Wikidata to find the correct entity representing the football club.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\":\"wikidata\",\"query\":\"Fulham\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "call_L0cyDKubKY43fBea4tdVt6uN", "type": "function"}], "annotations": []}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
