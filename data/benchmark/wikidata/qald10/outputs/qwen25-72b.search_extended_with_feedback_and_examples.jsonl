Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many years did the second oldest dog in the world live?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "48045976ec9a44f0b007fe89e08236d1", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many years did the second oldest dog in the world live?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the second highest mountain on Earth?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?res WHERE {\n  ?res wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q8502 .\n  ?res wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n  ?res wdt:P30 / wdt:P361 wd:Q2 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?elevation )\nLIMIT 1\nOFFSET 1\n\nUsing entities:\nEarth, also known as World, The Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Mother Earth (wd:Q2): third planet from the Sun in the Solar System\nmountain, also known as mt., mtn., mountains, mount (wd:Q8502): large natural elevation of the Earth's surface\n\nUsing properties:\nelevation above sea level, also known as MAMSL, MASL, height, elevation above mean sea level, elevation (wd:P2044 as wdt): height of the item (geographical object) as measured relative to sea level\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ncontinent (wd:P30 as wdt): continent of which the subject is a part, located in/on physical feature\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\npart of, also known as of, within, system of, subsystem of, subgroup of (wd:P361 as wdt): object of which the subject is a part (if this subject is alread... of \"has part\" (P527, see also \"has parts of the class\" (P2670))", "tool_call_id": "48045976ec9a44f0b007fe89e08236d1"}, {"content": "Based on the example, we need to find the second oldest dog in the world and then get its age.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many fictional female swordfighters are there?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "25c31d6bba5c4333a6a1fd4916edf69b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many fictional female swordfighters are there?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nGive me all female German chancellors.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P21 wd:Q6581072 .\n  ?uri wdt:P39 wd:Q4970706 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFederal Chancellor of Germany, also known as German Federal Chancellor, prime minister of Germany, German Chancellor, Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Federal Chancellor (wd:Q4970706): head of government of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)\nfemale, also known as female human, women, woman, lady, human female (wd:Q6581072): to be used in \"sex or gender\" (P21) to indicate that the human s...nder\" (P10339) to indicate that a word refers to a female person\n\nUsing properties:\nsex or gender, also known as gender or sex, sex, gender identity, gender expression, gender (wd:P21 as wdt): sex or gender identity of human or animal.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Was Shaquille O'Neal the teammate of Kobe Bryant in the year of 2000?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "17308eab32b44d1d8dbb907aaab88d3f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Was Shaquille O'Neal the teammate of Kobe Bryant in the year of 2000?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWho is the tallest basketball player?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P106 wd:Q3665646 ; wdt:P2048 ?height .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?height )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nbasketball player, also known as basketballer, basketeer, cager, hoopster, professional basketball player (wd:Q3665646): person who plays in basketball\n\nUsing properties:\noccupation, also known as job, work, vocation, profession, employment (wd:P106 as wdt): occupation of a person; see also \"field of work\" (Property:P101), \"position held\" (Property:P39)\nheight, also known as heighth, size, depth over terrain (wd:P2048 as wdt): vertical length of an entity, length", "tool_call_id": "17308eab32b44d1d8dbb907aaab88d3f"}, {"content": "None of the examples directly answer the question about Shaquille O'Neal being a teammate of Kobe Bryant in 2000.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many cities are part of the Pearl River Delta?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "799f448d5a0c4fd5823139e2476f3a57", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many cities are part of the Pearl River Delta?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nHow many emperors did China have?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ( COUNT( DISTINCT ?uri ) as ?count ) WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P39 wd:Q268218\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nEmperor of China, also known as Huang-ti, Huang Ti, Son of Heaven, thearch, Ti (wd:Q268218): sovereign of Imperial China\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as wdt): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nHow many rivers and lakes are in South Carolina?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ( COUNT( ?uri ) AS ?c ) WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P131 wd:Q1456 .\n  ?uri wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q23397 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nSouth Carolina, also known as S.C., S.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "among the other representative work of the author of hunter x hunter, which one is talking about middle school student?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ec1a8a382c8c41b2a679edc4f24a030b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"among the other representative work of the author of hunter x hunter, which one is talking about middle school student?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat other books have been written by the author of The Fault in Our Stars?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q658375 wdt:P50 ?author .\n  ?uri wdt:P50 ?author .\n  FILTER ( ?uri != wd:Q658375 )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Fault in Our Stars, also known as TFiOS (wd:Q658375): novel by John Green\n\nUsing properties:\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWho wrote The Hunger Games?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q11679 wdt:P50 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nThe Hunger Games, also known as Hunger Games Saga, The Hunger Games Saga (wd:Q11679): three books by Suzanne Collins (2008\u20132010)\n\nUsing properties:\nauthor, also known as writer, written by, poet, playwright, maker (wd:P50 as wdt): main creator(s) of a written work (use on works, not humans); us...hor name string) when Wikidata item is unknown or does not exist, creator\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhich country does the creator of Miffy come from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q1501505 wdt:P170 ?creator .\n  ?creator wdt:P27 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMiffy (wd:Q1501505): female rabbit character in a series of picture books drawn and written by Dick Bruna\n\nUsing properties:\ncreator, also known as created by, visual artist, sculptor, sculpted by, realized by (wd:P170 as wdt): maker of this creative work or other object (where no more specific property exists)\ncountry of citizenship, also known as subject of (country), nation of citizenship, national of, nationality, nation (wd:P27 as wdt): the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen, country", "tool_call_id": "ec1a8a382c8c41b2a679edc4f24a030b"}, {"content": "Based on the examples, we need to identify the author of Hunter x Hunter and then find their other works.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the capital of Iran bigger than that of Germany?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ac44ee6719ab463a80cd91df2d43c46f", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Is the capital of Iran bigger than that of Germany?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nhow much is the population densty rank of germany?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ( COUNT( DISTINCT ?country ) as ?cnt ) {\n  ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 ; wdt:P1082 ?population ; wdt:P2046 ?area .\n  wd:Q183 wdt:P1082 ?germanPopulation .\n  wd:Q183 wdt:P2046 ?germanArea .\n  BIND( ( ?population / ?area ) AS ?density ) BIND( ( ?germanPopulation / ?germanArea ) AS ?germanDensity ) FILTER ( ?density > ?germanDensity )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGermany, also known as BR Deutschland, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Deutschland, Federal Republic of Germany (wd:Q183): country in Central Europe\ncountry, also known as countries (wd:Q6256): distinct territorial body or political entity\n\nUsing properties:\npopulation, also known as inhabitants, human population (wd:P1082 as wdt): number of people inhabiting the place; number of people of subject\narea, also known as total area, surface area, surface, size, resolution (wd:P2046 as wdt): area occupied by an object\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the smallest city by area in Germany?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?res WHERE {\n  ?res wdt:P17 wd:Q183 .\n  ?res wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q515 .\n  ?res wdt:P1082 ?inhabitants .\n}\nORDER BY ?inhabitants\nLIMIt 1\n\nUsing entities:\nGermany, also known as BR Deutschland, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Deutschland, Federal Republic of Germany (wd:Q183): country in Central Europe\ncity, also known as cities (wd:Q515): large human settlement\n\nUsing properties:\npopulation, also known as inhabitants, human population (wd:P1082 as wdt): number of people inhabiting the place; number of people of subject\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWith how many countries Iran has borders?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q794 wdt:P47 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIran, also known as ir, IRI, IRN, Islamic Rep.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the binary gender of the partner of Allen Ginsberg ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "9c44605c4ea74e88af5b2e2d4888faf9", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"What is the binary gender of the partner of Allen Ginsberg ?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "9c44605c4ea74e88af5b2e2d4888faf9"}, {"content": "Since no similar examples were found, we'll proceed by identifying the relevant entities and properties.\n\nFirst, let's find the entity for Allen Ginsberg.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"Allen Ginsberg\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-025264321fb4404ebef924d205e73979", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the current president of the German Bundestag currently?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "b5e8b89f5a7940be89c87bfc79c3dfc4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Who is the current president of the German Bundestag currently?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWho is the mayor of Berlin?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?o1 WHERE {\n  wd:Q64 wdt:P6 ?o1 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nBerlin, also known as Berlin (Germany), Berlin, Germany, DE-BE (wd:Q64): federated state, capital and largest city of Germany\n\nUsing properties:\nhead of government, also known as head of national government, mayor, premier, president, prime minister (wd:P6 as wdt): head of the executive power of this town, city, municipality, state, country, or other governmental body, director / manager, chairperson\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nGive me all federal chancellors of Germany.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P39 wd:Q4970706 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFederal Chancellor of Germany, also known as German Federal Chancellor, prime minister of Germany, German Chancellor, Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Federal Chancellor (wd:Q4970706): head of government of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)\n\nUsing properties:\nposition held, also known as function, held position, holds position, job, office held (wd:P39 as wdt): subject currently or formerly holds the object position or public office\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the alma mater of the chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?res WHERE {\n  wd:Q567 wdt:P69 ?res .\n  ?res wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q3918 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nuniversity, also known as uni, universities (wd:Q3918): academic institution for further education\nAngela Merkel, also known as Angela Dorothea Merkel, leader of the free world, Angela Kasner (wd:Q567): chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021, politician, physicist\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\neducated at, also known as graduated from, graduate of, place of education, school attended, schooled at (wd:P69 as wdt): educational institution attended by subject, affiliation", "tool_call_id": "b5e8b89f5a7940be89c87bfc79c3dfc4"}, {"content": "From the examples, we see that we need to identify the entity for the German Bundestag and the property for the current president or speaker of the Bundestag.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

However, \"cast member\" (wd:P161) is also a common property used for this purpose, especially in the context of TV shows and movies.\n\nLet's use both properties to ensure we cover all possibilities. We'll start by finding the creators of \"The OA\" and then check if any of those creators are also listed as performers or cast members in the show.\n\nHere is the initial SPARQL query to find the creators of \"The OA\":\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?creator WHERE {\n  wd:Q19798744 wdt:P170 ?creator .\n}\n```\n\nLet's execute this query.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"SELECT ?creator WHERE { wd:Q19798744 wdt:P170 ?creator . }\"}", "name": "execute"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-68748ec9d1694e30817acef85246f134", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Got 2 rows and 1 column:\n| creator                       |\n| ----------------------------- |\n| Zal Batmanglij (wd:Q13499404) |\n| Brit Marling (wd:Q289380)     |", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-68748ec9d1694e30817acef85246f134"}, {"content": "The creators of \"The OA\" are Zal Batmanglij (wd:Q13499404) and Brit Marling (wd:Q289380).

Here is the SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?creator WHERE {\n  wd:Q19798744 wdt:P170 ?creator .\n  FILTER EXISTS {\n    { ?creator wdt:P175 wd:Q19798744 }\n    UNION\n    { ?creator wdt:P161 wd:Q19798744 }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet's execute this query.\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"SELECT ?creator WHERE { wd:Q19798744 wdt:P170 ?creator .

Let's try another approach by checking if they have any roles in the show.\n\nWe'll use the property `character role` (wd:P453) to see if they have any roles in \"The OA\". Here is the updated SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?creator WHERE {\n  wd:Q19798744 wdt:P170 ?creator .\n  FILTER EXISTS {\n    { ?creator wdt:P453 ?role }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet's execute this query.\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"SELECT ?creator WHERE { wd:Q19798744 wdt:P170 ?creator .

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Did Germany have a population growth of at least 1% since 2010?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "35902ed30840414193aa8be7b9b6656b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Did Germany have a population growth of at least 1% since 2010?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nhow much is the population densty rank of germany?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ( COUNT( DISTINCT ?country ) as ?cnt ) {\n  ?country wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 ; wdt:P1082 ?population ; wdt:P2046 ?area .\n  wd:Q183 wdt:P1082 ?germanPopulation .\n  wd:Q183 wdt:P2046 ?germanArea .\n  BIND( ( ?population / ?area ) AS ?density ) BIND( ( ?germanPopulation / ?germanArea ) AS ?germanDensity ) FILTER ( ?density > ?germanDensity )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGermany, also known as BR Deutschland, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Deutschland, Federal Republic of Germany (wd:Q183): country in Central Europe\ncountry, also known as countries (wd:Q6256): distinct territorial body or political entity\n\nUsing properties:\npopulation, also known as inhabitants, human population (wd:P1082 as wdt): number of people inhabiting the place; number of people of subject\narea, also known as total area, surface area, surface, size, resolution (wd:P2046 as wdt): area occupied by an object\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich German cities have more than 250000 inhabitants?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?s1 WHERE {\n  ?s1 wdt:P17 wd:Q183 .\n  ?s1 wdt:P31 wd:Q515 .\n  ?s1 wdt:P1082 ?o1 .\n  FILTER ( ?o1 > \"250000\" ^^ xsd:integer )\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nGermany, also known as BR Deutschland, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Deutschland, Federal Republic of Germany (wd:Q183): country in Central Europe\ncity, also known as cities (wd:Q515): large human settlement\n\nUsing properties:\npopulation, also known as inhabitants, human population (wd:P1082 as wdt): number of people inhabiting the place; number of people of subject\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the smallest city by area in Germany?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?res WHERE {\n  ?res wdt:P17 wd:Q183 .\n  ?res wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q515 .\n  ?res wdt:P1082 ?inhabitants .\n}\nORDER BY ?inhabitants\nLIMIt 1\n\nUsing entities:\nGermany, also known as BR Deutschland, Bundesrepublik Deutschland, Deutschland, Federal Republic of Germany (wd:Q183): country in Central Europe\ncity, also known as cities (wd:Q515): large human settlement\n\nUsing properties:\npopulation, also known as inhabitants, human population (wd:P1082 as wdt): number of people inhabiting the place; number of people of subject\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "35902ed30840414193aa8be7b9b6656b"}, {"content": "From the examples, we can see that the population of Germany can be retrieved using the property `wdt:P1082`.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which songs made up the album Fijaci\u00f3n Oral vol. 1 ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "fbdc427a1f8d4e6ca2171f19486379f6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Which songs made up the album Fijaci\\u00f3n Oral vol. 1 ?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat was the first Queen album?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q482994 .\n  ?uri wdt:P175 wd:Q15862 .\n  ?uri wdt:P577 ?date\n}\nORDER BY ?date\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nQueen (wd:Q15862): British musical group; rock band\nalbum, also known as full album, record album, music album, full-length album, audio album (wd:Q482994): grouping of album releases by an artist usually released at the ...racks but in different formats for consumption (digital, CD, LP)\n\nUsing properties:\nperformer, also known as actor, sung by, singer, recording by, recorded by (wd:P175 as wdt): actor, musician, band or other performer associated with this role or musical work, contributor to the creative work or subject\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\npublication date, also known as launched, published, publication time, publication, pubdate (wd:P577 as wdt): date or point in time when a work was first published or released, point in time", "tool_call_id": "fbdc427a1f8d4e6ca2171f19486379f6"}, {"content": "None of the examples directly match our question, but we can use them as a starting point.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is native name of the composer of the Japanese national anthem?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "16b84b65bb20426e8f687d595e424fec", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"What is native name of the composer of the Japanese national anthem?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nIn which countries do people speak Japanese?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q6256 .\n  ?uri wdt:P37 wd:Q5287 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJapanese, also known as Japanese language, Japanesic (wd:Q5287): language spoken in East Asia\ncountry, also known as countries (wd:Q6256): distinct territorial body or political entity\n\nUsing properties:\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nofficial language, also known as language spoken, spoken in, speaking, language official (wd:P37 as wdt): language designated as official by this item, language used\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich country does the creator of Miffy come from?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q1501505 wdt:P170 ?creator .\n  ?creator wdt:P27 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMiffy (wd:Q1501505): female rabbit character in a series of picture books drawn and written by Dick Bruna\n\nUsing properties:\ncreator, also known as created by, visual artist, sculptor, sculpted by, realized by (wd:P170 as wdt): maker of this creative work or other object (where no more specific property exists)\ncountry of citizenship, also known as subject of (country), nation of citizenship, national of, nationality, nation (wd:P27 as wdt): the object is a country that recognizes the subject as its citizen, country\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nGive me all islands that belong to Japan.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q23442 ; wdt:P17 wd:Q17 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJapan, also known as State of Japan, Nippon-koku, Nippon, Nihon-koku, Nihon (wd:Q17): island country in East Asia\nisland, also known as islands, isle (wd:Q23442): piece of sub-continental land completely surrounded by water\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)", "tool_call_id": "16b84b65bb20426e8f687d595e424fec"}, {"content": "From these examples, we can see that we need to identify the composer of the Japanese national anthem and then find their native name.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

For example, we can look for properties related to the start year and number of seasons.\n\n#### Search for Alternative Properties\n\n1. **Start Year**:\n   - We have already used `wdt:P571` (inception).\n   - Let's check if there are any other properties related to the start year.\n\n2. **Number of Seasons**:\n   - We have already used `wdt:P2437` (number of seasons).\n   - Let's check if there are any other properties related to the number of seasons.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Refined Query\n\nLet's execute the refined query to see if it returns any results.\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?show ?showLabel ?startDate ?seasons WHERE {\n  ?show wdt:P31 wd:Q5398426 .  # ?show is a television series\n  ?show wdt:P161 wd:Q23760 .   # ?show stars Rowan Atkinson\n  ?show wdt:P2437 4 .          # ?show has exactly 4 seasons\n  ?show wdt:P571 ?startDate .  # ?show started in a certain year\n  FILTER(YEAR(?startDate) = 1983)\n  OPTIONAL { ?show rdfs:label ?showLabel .

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is the creator of the Dinosaurs tv show ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "2e86d783905c4dd28cac53f60b848e18", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Who is the creator of the Dinosaurs tv show ?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich television shows were created by Walt Disney?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q7725310 ; wdt:P170 wd:Q8704 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nseries of creative works, also known as serial (wd:Q7725310): ordered set of creative works\nWalt Disney (wd:Q8704): American animator and producer (1901\u20131966), television presenter, film producer, film director, caricaturist, manufacturer, screenwriter, illustrator, voice actor, film actor, producer, director, animator, inventor, painter, writer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncreator, also known as created by, visual artist, sculptor, sculpted by, realized by (wd:P170 as wdt): maker of this creative work or other object (where no more specific property exists)\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich television shows were created by John Cleese?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q5398426 .\n  {\n    ?uri wdt:P170 wd:Q25014 .\n  } UNION {\n    ?uri wdt:P170 / wdt:P527 wd:Q25014 .\n  }\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn Cleese, also known as John Marwood Cleese (wd:Q25014): English comedian and actor (born 1939), television actor, autobiographer, film producer, film director, screenwriter, stage actor, voice actor, film actor, comedian, writer, actor\ntelevision series, also known as TV show, TV-series, television show, TV series (wd:Q5398426): connected set of television program episodes under the same title\n\nUsing properties:\ncreator, also known as created by, visual artist, sculptor, sculpted by, realized by (wd:P170 as wdt): maker of this creative work or other object (where no more specific property exists)\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nhas part(s), also known as has component, incorporates, has ingredient, has ingredients, has member (wd:P527 as wdt): part of this subject; inverse property of \"part of\" (P361).

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

The query is filtering out the works that are part of 'The Witcher' series, which is good, but it appears that there are no other notable works by Andrzej Sapkowski according to the current query. This could be due to the fact that the notable works might not be directly linked to the author through the P800 property. Try to include other properties that might link the author to his works, such as 'author' (P50)."}, {"content": "Thank you for the feedback.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many african-american people got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "ba0259f851a34102ba621bfd51aaa208", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many african-american people got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "ba0259f851a34102ba621bfd51aaa208"}, {"content": "There were no similar examples found.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "when was the creator of saturday night live born?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "b06f7942046b49e29aeca58f240f32b4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"when was the creator of saturday night live born?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWho created Family Guy?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q5930 wdt:P170 ?uri\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nFamily Guy (wd:Q5930): American adult animated sitcom\n\nUsing properties:\ncreator, also known as created by, visual artist, sculptor, sculpted by, realized by (wd:P170 as wdt): maker of this creative work or other object (where no more specific property exists)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhich television shows were created by John Cleese?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q5398426 .\n  {\n    ?uri wdt:P170 wd:Q25014 .\n  } UNION {\n    ?uri wdt:P170 / wdt:P527 wd:Q25014 .\n  }\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nJohn Cleese, also known as John Marwood Cleese (wd:Q25014): English comedian and actor (born 1939), television actor, autobiographer, film producer, film director, screenwriter, stage actor, voice actor, film actor, comedian, writer, actor\ntelevision series, also known as TV show, TV-series, television show, TV series (wd:Q5398426): connected set of television program episodes under the same title\n\nUsing properties:\ncreator, also known as created by, visual artist, sculptor, sculpted by, realized by (wd:P170 as wdt): maker of this creative work or other object (where no more specific property exists)\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\nhas part(s), also known as has component, incorporates, has ingredient, has ingredients, has member (wd:P527 as wdt): part of this subject; inverse property of \"part of\" (P361).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is Chicago located at Lake Michigan?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "147eda912021453897852b9cb02ce6dc", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Is Chicago located at Lake Michigan?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich states border Illinois?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q1204 wdt:P47 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nIllinois, also known as The Prairie State, Illinois, United States, The Land of Lincoln, US-IL, Prairie State (wd:Q1204): state of the United States of America\n\nUsing properties:\nshares border with, also known as shares borders with, next to, bordered by, border, borders clockwise (wd:P47 as wdt): countries or administrative subdivisions, of equal level, that t...rders, either by land or water.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many Oscars did all the movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki combined win?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "1b6aab16a5cc43eeb8a6381aca961697", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many Oscars did all the movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki combined win?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich movies did Kurosawa direct?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P57 wd:Q8006 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAkira Kurosawa, also known as Kurosawa Akira, Kurosawa (wd:Q8006): Japanese filmmaker (1910\u20131998), film producer, film director, screenwriter, film editor, producer, director, painter, writer\n\nUsing properties:\ndirector, also known as film director, movie director, game director, directed by (wd:P57 as wdt): director(s) of film, TV-series, stageplay, video game or similar, contributor to the creative work or subject, creator\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nHow many films did Leonardo DiCaprio star in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ( COUNT( DISTINCT ?uri ) AS ?c ) WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q11424 ; wdt:P161 wd:Q38111 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfilm, also known as cinematic work, moving picture, movie, motion pictures, motion picture (wd:Q11424): sequence of images that give the impression of movement, stored on film stock\nLeonardo DiCaprio (wd:Q38111): American actor and film producer (born 1974), television actor, environmentalist, film producer, screenwriter, stage actor, film actor, actor\n\nUsing properties:\ncast member, also known as feat., starring (film/play), film starring, starring, actor (wd:P161 as wdt): actor in the subject production [use \"character role\" (P453) and...use \"recorded participant\" (P11108) for non-fiction productions], significant person, performer\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nGive me all movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q11424 ; wdt:P57 wd:Q56094 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nfilm, also known as cinematic work, moving picture, movie, motion pictures, motion picture (wd:Q11424): sequence of images that give the impression of movement, stored on film stock\nFrancis Ford Coppola, also known as Francis Coppola (wd:Q56094): American filmmaker, executive producer, businessperson, film producer, film director, screenwriter, film editor, winegrower, film actor, producer, director, composer, writer, actor\n\nUsing properties:\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\ndirector, also known as film director, movie director, game director, directed by (wd:P57 as wdt): director(s) of film, TV-series, stageplay, video game or similar, contributor to the creative work or subject, creator", "tool_call_id": "1b6aab16a5cc43eeb8a6381aca961697"}, {"content": "Based on these examples, we need to identify the movies directed by Hayao Miyazaki and then count the number of Oscars won by these movies.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "People of what age belong to the Silent Generation ?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a46934ea4f134620a04d26e3a00a4aff", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"People of what age belong to the Silent Generation ?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nList the children of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q7416 wdt:P40 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMargaret Thatcher, also known as Margaret Hilda Thatcher, Margaret Roberts, Margaret Hilda Roberts, Mrs. T, Mrs. Thatcher (wd:Q7416): British stateswoman and prime minister (1925\u20132013), research scientist, business executive, autobiographer, statesperson, politician, barrister, chemist\n\nUsing properties:\nchild, also known as has son, kids, mother of, kid, issue (wd:P40 as wdt): subject has object as child.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Were at least two of the founders of tencent educated at the same university?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "c03024ef25c94407badd8874f51c766b", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Were at least two of the founders of tencent educated at the same university?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhich electronics companies were founded in Beijing?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?company WHERE {\n  ?company wdt:P452 wd:Q581105 ; wdt:P740 wd:Q956 .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nconsumer electronics, also known as home electronics, household electronics (wd:Q581105): electronic equipment intended for everyday use, typically in private homes\nBeijing, also known as Pei-ping, Peip'ing, Peiping, Pekin, Pe-king (wd:Q956): capital city of China\n\nUsing properties:\nindustry, also known as branch, economic branch, field of action, field of exercise, sector (wd:P452 as wdt): specific industry of company or organization, part of\nlocation of formation, also known as place of incorporation, originates from, place of establishment, place of formation, place of foundation (wd:P740 as wdt): location where a group or organization was formed, location of creation", "tool_call_id": "c03024ef25c94407badd8874f51c766b"}, {"content": "The example provided does not directly relate to our question about the education of Tencent's founders.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is the Mariana Trench deeper than Mount Everest is high (above sea level)?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "cd97e8547e244ee0b72b81f4e22110b4", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Is the Mariana Trench deeper than Mount Everest is high (above sea level)?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the highest mountain?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  ?uri wdt:P31 wd:Q8502 ; wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?elevation )\nLIMIT 1\n\nUsing entities:\nmountain, also known as mt., mtn., mountains, mount (wd:Q8502): large natural elevation of the Earth's surface\n\nUsing properties:\nelevation above sea level, also known as MAMSL, MASL, height, elevation above mean sea level, elevation (wd:P2044 as wdt): height of the item (geographical object) as measured relative to sea level\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion:\nWhat country is Mount Everest in?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT DISTINCT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q513 wdt:P17 ?uri .\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nMount Everest, also known as Chomolungma, Chomolangma, Zhumulangma, World highest peak, Sagarm\u0101th\u0101 (wd:Q513): Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas\n\nUsing properties:\ncountry, also known as sovereign state, state, land, host country (wd:P17 as wdt): sovereign state that this item is in (not to be used for human beings), located in the administrative territorial entity\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion:\nWhat is the second highest mountain on Earth?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?res WHERE {\n  ?res wdt:P31 / wdt:P279 * wd:Q8502 .\n  ?res wdt:P2044 ?elevation .\n  ?res wdt:P30 / wdt:P361 wd:Q2 .\n}\nORDER BY DESC ( ?elevation )\nLIMIT 1\nOFFSET 1\n\nUsing entities:\nEarth, also known as World, The Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Mother Earth (wd:Q2): third planet from the Sun in the Solar System\nmountain, also known as mt., mtn., mountains, mount (wd:Q8502): large natural elevation of the Earth's surface\n\nUsing properties:\nelevation above sea level, also known as MAMSL, MASL, height, elevation above mean sea level, elevation (wd:P2044 as wdt): height of the item (geographical object) as measured relative to sea level\nsubclass of, also known as rdfs:subClassOf, sort of, subcategory of, subgenre of, subtype of (wd:P279 as wdt): this item is a subclass (subset) of that item; ALL instances of ...stance of volcanic landform); Everest is an instance of mountain\ncontinent (wd:P30 as wdt): continent of which the subject is a part, located in/on physical feature\ninstance of, also known as unitary element of class, has type, unique individual of, type, item of type (wd:P31 as wdt): that class of which this subject is a particular example and mem...is a subclass of mountain (and an instance of volcanic landform)\npart of, also known as of, within, system of, subsystem of, subgroup of (wd:P361 as wdt): object of which the subject is a part (if this subject is alread... of \"has part\" (P527, see also \"has parts of the class\" (P2670))", "tool_call_id": "cd97e8547e244ee0b72b81f4e22110b4"}, {"content": "From the examples, we can see that the properties `wdt:P2044` (elevation above sea level) and `wdt:P4511` (maximum depth) are relevant to our question.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is ALDI also in Italy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "458335a81c8b40e9ae1e4a11595d592e", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Is ALDI also in Italy?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Example 1:\nQuestion:\nWho owns Aldi?\n\nSPARQL:\nSELECT ?uri WHERE {\n  wd:Q125054 wdt:P355 ?uri\n}\n\nUsing entities:\nAldi, also known as Aldi Stores (wd:Q125054): brand name of two global discount supermarket chains\n\nUsing properties:\nhas subsidiary, also known as subordinate body, subsidiary body, subordinate unit, subsidiary, subsidiary company (wd:P355 as wdt): subsidiary of a company or organization; generally a fully owned...siness division\" (P199).

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many studio albums has Lana Del Rey have?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "792fe1e06c52421e9f5a93a359182b92", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many studio albums has Lana Del Rey have?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "792fe1e06c52421e9f5a93a359182b92"}, {"content": "Since no examples were found, let's start by searching for the entity \"Lana Del Rey\" in the knowledge graph.\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"query\": \"Lana Del Rey\"}", "name": "search_entity"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-764b41d27a47430f9110b2a41a8c3e90", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Top 10 entity alternatives:\n1.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

We can use `P17` (country) to find the countries associated with Lake Constance and then verify if these countries have a direct connection to the lake using `P361` (part of) or `P47` (borders).\n\nHere is the final refined SPARQL query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?country) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  wd:Q4127 wdt:P17 ?country .\n  {\n    ?lakePart wdt:P361 wd:Q4127 .\n    ?lakePart wdt:P17 ?country .\n  } UNION {\n    ?country wdt:P47 ?border .\n    FILTER(?border = wd:Q4127)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis query will count the countries that are associated with Lake Constance and either have parts of the lake within their territory or share a border with the lake.\n\nLet's execute this final refined query.\n\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?country) AS ?count) WHERE { wd:Q4127 wdt:P17 ?country . { ?lakePart wdt:P361 wd:Q4127 . ?lakePart wdt:P17 ?country . } UNION { ?country wdt:P47 ?border .

The discrepancy might be due to the specific data modeling in Wikidata.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and reliable answer based on the data available is:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?country) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  wd:Q4127 wdt:P17 ?country .\n}\n```\n\nThis query correctly identifies and counts the countries around Lake Constance.\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query and the answer:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?country) AS ?count) WHERE {\n  wd:Q4127 wdt:P17 ?country .\n}\n```\n\nAnswer: 3\n\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?country) AS ?count) WHERE { wd:Q4127 wdt:P17 ?country . }\", \"answer\": \"3\"}", "name": "answer"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-81331838ee3843d283f4abaa6e11a766", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Stopped generation process", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-81331838ee3843d283f4abaa6e11a766"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Feedback (status=done):\nThe SPARQL query is correct and returns the expected result.

The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How many casualties were a result of the Troubles?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "904dff91854144598bf982d77f9df970", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"How many casualties were a result of the Troubles?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "904dff91854144598bf982d77f9df970"}, {"content": "There are no similar examples.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties.

Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints. Use rdfs:label or similar properties to get labels instead."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Which animal participated in a military operation with the Australian Defence Force?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's start by looking at some similar examples.", "tool_calls": [{"id": "09e044458f0e4f208954798979bee9c6", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "find_similar_examples", "arguments": "{\n  \"kg\": \"wikidata\",\n  \"question\": \"Which animal participated in a military operation with the Australian Defence Force?\"\n}"}}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "No examples found", "tool_call_id": "09e044458f0e4f208954798979bee9c6"}, {"content": "There were no similar examples found.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6.

Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries.

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.

This query covers all possible ways Python could be classified as a programming language, including direct instances, subclasses, and instances of subclasses.\n\n### Final SPARQL Query and Answer\n\nHere is the final SPARQL query and answer:\n\n```sparql\nASK WHERE {\n  { wd:Q28865 wdt:P31 wd:Q9143 }\n  UNION\n  { wd:Q28865 wdt:P279* wd:Q9143 }\n  UNION\n  { wd:Q28865 wdt:P31 ?subclass . ?subclass wdt:P279* wd:Q9143 }\n}\n```\n\nThe answer is **True**.\n\nLet's provide the final answer.\n\n\n\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"kg\": \"wikidata\", \"sparql\": \"ASK WHERE { { wd:Q28865 wdt:P31 wd:Q9143 } UNION { wd:Q28865 wdt:P279* wd:Q9143 } UNION { wd:Q28865 wdt:P31 ?subclass . ?subclass wdt:P279* wd:Q9143 } }\", \"answer\": \"True\"}", "name": "answer"}, "id": "chatcmpl-tool-816b8955c1d24030b57a9b3f959b4d42", "type": "function"}]}, {"role": "tool", "content": "Stopped generation process", "tool_call_id": "chatcmpl-tool-816b8955c1d24030b57a9b3f959b4d42"}], "id": "test_144"}

Determine possible entities and properties implied by the user question.\n2. Use the functions to search for entities and properties in the knowledge graphs. Where applicable, constrain the searches with already identified entities and properties.\n3. Gradually build up the SPARQL query using the identified entities and properties. Start with simple queries and add more complexity as needed. Use the execute function to get feedback on intermediate queries. You can go back and forth between knowledge graph searches and SPARQL query executions to refine the query.\n4. Use the answer or cancel function to finalize your answer and stop the generation process.\n\nAdditional rules:\n1. Explain your thought process before and after each step and function call.\n2. Do not assume or make up any entities or properties without verifying them with the knowledge graphs and functions.\n3. The SPARQL query should always return the actual identifiers / IRIs of the items in its result. It additionally may return labels or other human-readable information, but they are optional and should be put within optional clauses unless explicitly requested by the user.\n4. Do not stop early if there are still obvious improvements to be made to the SPARQL query. For example, keep refining your SPARQL query if its result contains irrelevant items or is missing items you expected.\n5. Do not perform additional computation (e.g. filtering, sorting, calculations) on the result of the SPARQL query to determine the answer. All computation should be done solely within SPARQL.\n6. For questions with a \"True\" or \"False\" answer the SPARQL query should be an ASK query.\n7. Do not use 'SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language ...' in SPARQL queries. It is not SPARQL standard and unsupported by the used QLever SPARQL endpoints.
